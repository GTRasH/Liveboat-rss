At the ceremony in the adminstrative capital Dodoma, Hassan said it's time to unite the country. The electoral commission said she won around 97% of the vote. The elections had been marred by deadly violence. Demonstrators took to the streets to protest the exclusion of Hassan's main challengers. The opposition says hundreds of people were killed by police in the unrest. The government denies use of excessive force.

Deogratias Munishi speaks for Tanzania's main opposition party Chadema, which was barred from the election. He talks to DW from Nairobi, Kenya, to share his take on the president's 97% election victory.

It helps troops prepare for combat and train in realistic scenarios. that shows the position of USS Iwo Jima, the ship where these live-shooting drills were happening. The imagery shows the ship less than 200km away from the coastline of Venezuela.USS Iwo Jima is anamphibious assault ship that serves as a core component of US expeditionary forces, capable of launching amphibious invasions.USS Iwo Jima was also seen accompanied by two other USS destroyers, within around 20km of each other.The ship's arrival follows the announcement that the USS Gerald R Ford Aircraft carrier is also being moved towards the Caribbean Sea, with three US destroyers alongside it.Sean Parnell, assistant to the Secretary of War for Public Affairs, said in a statement on X on 24 October that the forces will "enhance and augment existing capabilities to disrupt narcotics trafficking and degrade and dismantle" transnational criminal organisations.He was thought to be describing fishing boats which they suspected of trafficking drugs, but so far there is no evidence to confirm this.The deployment means there will be 14% of the US Navy's fleet in the Caribbean, showing a significant build-up of force.USS Gerald R Ford was spotted just off the coast of Italy on its way to the Caribbean on 29 October.Mr Cancian, senior advisor of defence and security at the Centre for Strategic International Studies (CSIS), told Sky News: "The United States only has 11 carriers, three are at sea at any one time. So, moving one of them into the Caribbean is very significant, it does a couple of things. It puts more pressure on the Maduro regime, and it brings a lot of combat power into the Caribbean."He described the USS Gerald R Ford as a "use it or lose it" asset, saying "it's so powerful and so scarce, carrier strike groups, that other regional commanders will want to use the battle group".He added, when the airstrike carrier arrives in the Caribbean, a decision will have to be made."If the administration wants to conduct strikes, the arrival of the Ford would open that window for those attacks," he said.On 30 October, the Wall Street Journal reported that US officials said the Trump administration has identified targets in Venezuela that include military facilities used to smuggle drugs.Is the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier the best military asset for targeting drug boats?Nick Brown, director at Janes defence intelligence company, told Sky News the "Gerald R Ford is the US Navy's newest aircraft carrier and the largest warship currently in US service".He said there are 4,805 crew members on board and a full range of precision air-to-surface bombs, missiles and rockets, "able to tackle a wide variety of tactical and strategic targets".The aircraft carrier also carries an abundance of fighter jets, typically 24 F/A-18s and 24 F-35s.Mr Cancian said: "It's not a very good asset for countering drug traffic. The strike aircraft are very powerful, but they move too fast to identify small boats. There are some helicopters that could help, but what the carrier is very good at is attacks against adversary military forces or targets ashore."The strike aircraft operate at 500, 600mph. So, they're going very fast. And to spot a small boat and then to identify it, very difficult."Increasing pressure in the skiesAs well as the sea, the US appears to have been more active in the air over the Caribbean Sea. Flight tracking data shows the US have flown bombers off the Venezuelan coast, B1s and B52s.The B1-B bomber is primarily a fast, heavy-hitting conventional "bomb truck" designed rapidly to deliver massive amounts of precision weapons, while the B-52 bomber is a versatile, long-range "missile truck".Flight tracking data from 27 October shows two B1-B bomber jets flying over the Caribbean Sea."The administration has flown bombers off the Venezuelan coast, B1s and B52s. So, they have been steadily increasing the pressure," Mr Cancian said.Three B-52 bombers were also seen on flight tracking on 30 October, leaving from Jacksonville (Florida) and Shreveport (Louisiana). They circled their surrounding areas for two hours before returning to their base.The satellite imagery below shows six F35-B fighter jets, capable of performing air-to-surface, electronic warfare, intelligence gathering, and air-to-air missions simultaneously at Puerto Rico on 17 October.Uptick of strikes in the Pacific US Southern Command have been criticised for choosing targets in the Caribbean Sea rather than the Eastern Pacific.Mr Cancian explained that "much of the drug traffic that comes to the United States allegedly comes along the Pacific route... so not focusing on that flow" was considered curious.On 28 October, the US Southern Command defended their operational targets in a post on X saying: "The Department has spent over TWO DECADES defending other homelands. Now, we're defending our own. These narco-terrorists have killed more Americans than Al-Qaeda, and they will be treated the same. We will track them, we will network them, and then, we will hunt and kill them."The Data X Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

We take a deep dive into German arms exports, the history that made them so complicated, and how Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine has turned the political tide on weapons in Germany.

The peso enjoyed a boost and reform hopes rose, but veterans like Hans Humes warn that austerity still squeezes Argentina’s middle class and businesses. We examine what Milei’s next steps could mean for inflation, growth, and investors as the US steps in to offer its own financial support through a swap agreement. From Buenos Aires’ factory floors to global trading desks, the real test is whether momentum will hold.

Yet with a near-monopoly on lithography and rising demand for tech sovereignty, Europe may be better positioned than many think. Can it catch up — or is it too late?

Summers agrees with Fed Chair Powell’s reluctance to lock in a December rate cut. And, with new congressional momentum and a victory in midterm elections, Argentina’s President Javier Milei gets the electorate’s buy-in to continue economic reforms that have had mixed results. Plus, Geoffrey Hinton, the “Godfather of AI,” warns that the race to build smarter machines is outpacing efforts to control them, and that humanity must act before it’s too late. Later, will President Trump’s $100,000 H-1B visa fee actually solve the issues of misuse and poor pay, or will it starve the US of global talent?

He also credits President Trump with the progress made on trade with China, but warns that we are in the “early chapters” of the book.

New system takes effect on 12 November in move to prevent minors from accessing porn.</title><link>https://www.wantedinrome.com/news/italy-to-launch-age-verification-system-for-porn-sites.html</link><author>/u/Ok-Law-3268</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 10:27:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[New system takes effect on 12 November in move to prevent minors from accessing porn.Italy is to introduce a new age verification system for users attempting to access pornographic websites, the Italian Communications Authority (AGCOM) said on Friday.The move will take effect from 12 November and is aimed at preventing minors from accessing pornography online, in line with the European Digital Service Act to protect minors.AGCOM published an initial list of around 50 websites which will be subject to the stringent new rules, including well-known sites such as PornHub, YourPorn and OnlyFans, with the list set to be updated over time.The pilot programme will require users to verify their age when attempting to access websites featuring pornography or gambling as well as online platforms offering the sale of alcohol and cigarettes.Currently, to access porn sites, users simply have to declare that they are "18 or older" with the click of a button, leaving the system wide open to minors.The key change from 12 November will be the elimination of this self-declaration of age, with the new two-step system requiring verification from "certified third parties" such as a company, bank or mobile operator which already has this data.The third party verifies that the person is 18 years of age and then issues a code that can be used to access the porn site.The code contains only information about the person's age and no other information about their identity.The porn site then verifies the validity of the code and grants the user access.It will also be possible to use dedicated apps installed on users' smartphone or device, such as those linked to digital identity wallets.This age verification system must be carried out each time users access the site.The new system centres on privacy protection and the concept of "double anonymity", ensuring that the website only receives proof that the user is over 18, without knowing their identity.Simultaneously, the age verification provider knows the user's identity but not the specific website they are trying to access.In addition to following European regulations, the new AGCOM rules stem from the provisions set out in the so-called Caivano Law, the legislative decree approved in 2023 by Giorgia Meloni's government, which introduced several new measures to combat juvenile crime.Websites found to be in violation of the new rules after 12 November will reportedly be given 20 days to comply or risk being blocked within Italy by AGCOM.On Friday, Pornhub said the number of UK visitors to its website was down 77 per cent compared with July, when more rigorous age checks for sexually explicit sites were introduced under the Online Safety Act, the BBC reports.Britain's telecom and media regulator Ofcom said that visits to pornography sites in general in the UK have reduced by almost a third in the three months since age checks came into force on 25 July.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>REFILE: China launches Shenzhou-21 mission to Chinese space station | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZLeY1CAfW8</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/gZLeY1CAfW8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 10:24:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[China sent three astronauts to Tiangong in its seventh mission to the permanently inhabited Chinese space station since it was completed in 2022.

According to HUR, all three lines of the pipeline exploded simultaneously on the evening of October 31 in the Ramensky district near Moscow, rendering the system inoperative.The operation was confirmed by Ukraine’s military intelligence service on November 1. HUR reported that despite anti-drone defenses and armed security protecting the facility, “all three lines used to transport gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel were successfully and simultaneously destroyed.”The “Koltsovoy” pipeline served as a critical logistical link between several Russian refineries and military storage facilities. According to HUR, the system received fuel from refineries in Ryazan, Nizhny Novgorod, and Moscow, and had an annual capacity of up to 3 million tons of jet fuel, 2.8 million tons of diesel, and 1.6 million tons of gasoline. Russian emergency and security services reportedly arrived at the scene soon after the explosions, but the damage has left the infrastructure inoperable.HUR chief Kyrylo Budanov previously noted that Ukraine’s precision strikes on Russian logistics infrastructure had already inflicted greater losses on the Kremlin’s war machine than international sanctions. “In reality, our strikes have had more impact than sanctions,” Budanov said earlier this year. “It’s simply a mathematical truth.”Earlier, Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) and HUR carried out a covert operation that destroyed one of Russia’s top-secret “Oreshnik” strategic missile systems at the Kapustin Yar test range. According to SBU chief Vasyl Malyuk, it was a “100% successful strike,” personally overseen by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Andrew had &apos;40 prostitutes brought to five-star Thailand hotel room&apos; during four-day taxpayer funded trip, author claims</title><link>https://www.lbc.co.uk/article/andrew-prostitutes-thailand-trip-5HjdGCQ_2/</link><author>/u/esporx</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 09:20:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor had 40 prostitutes brought to his five-star hotel during a four-day trip to Thailand, the disgraced royal’s unauthorised biographer has claimed. 
Royal historian Andrew Lownie has alleged the disgraced former prince went on a string of taxpayer-funded trips which doubled up as holidays amid his “midlife crisis" in the early 2000s. It came after his brother, then-Prince Charles, reportedly advised against giving Andrew the Trade Envoy role in 2001 as he would just “chase women and play golf”.“In 2001, Andrew is 41, he's having his midlife crisis and he basically starts chasing lots and lots of women," Mr Lonie told the Daily Mail’s Deep Dive: The Fall of the House of York podcast. “He uses the excuse of his role as Trade Envoy, paid for by the taxpayer, to go off on these trips." He added: “He always puts in two weeks of ‘private time’. So, we pay for his holiday and then he goes off and does things.Where will Andrew live after being kicked out of Royal Lodge?Beatrice and Eugenie quietly left UK while Andrew was being stripped of titles“There was a famous trip to Thailand - for the birthday celebrations of the King. Andrew is representing his country and insists on staying in a five-star hotel rather than the embassy, which he always did.“Andrew had 40 prostitutes brought in the space of four days. This was all enabled by diplomats and others.”The historian claimed this figure has been verified by multiple sources, including a member of Thailand's royal family.Ian Proud, who headed up the political branch of the UK embassy in Thailand, has said the royal’s promiscuous behaviour was common knowledge among staff."He also came out on private trips to see his bits of fluff on the side, where we played a much lighter role in stewarding him through," he told the Metro. He added Andrew liked to have his own private space when he was on business and preferred not to stay in the embassy itself."When I was there he preferred a particular high end hotel because he liked the nightclub in the basement there with the floozies and so on," Mr Proud said.Andrew’s fall from grace continued rapidly this morning as he was swiftly removed from the Official Roll of the Peerage, the public record of peers and peerages of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom.The development marks a key step in formally removing his titles. Dukes, including the Duke of York, are listed on the roll of the peerage maintained at the Crown Office.As Lord Chancellor, David Lammy is responsible for maintaining the peerage roll. Andrew is still eighth in line to the throne behind Prince William, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, Prince Louis, Prince Harry, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.The only way Andrew could be removed from the line of succession would be through an Act of Parliament, but it would also require the consent of all other Commonwealth realms.Buckingham Palace said Andrew has agreed to leave the Windsor residence as his links to paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein continue to cause controversy.It is understood that although Andrew denies the accusations, Buckingham Palace considers the friendship a “serious lapses of judgment”.A statement released by the Palace on Thursday evening said: "His Majesty has today initiated a formal process to remove the Style, Titles and Honours of Prince Andrew."Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Child abductions rampant in northern Nigeria, but one girl is reunited with her mother | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/DqMlSDXVsUU</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/DqMlSDXVsUU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 08:45:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Salamatu Zubair’s world shattered when her 4-year-old was abducted in April 2025.

This was announced by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the state Assembly on Saturday.Vijayan made the announcement in a special session of the House convened on the occasion of Kerala '' or formation day."Today's Kerala Piravi marks a place in history because we have succeeded in making Kerala the first Indian state without extreme poverty. This Legislative Assembly has witnessed many historic laws and policy declarations. The Assembly now meets at a moment that marks yet another milestone in the creation of a Nava Kerala," he said.The Chief Minister said the eradication of extreme poverty was one of the key decisions taken at the first cabinet meeting after the new ministry was sworn in in 2021. "It was also the beginning of fulfilling one of the most important promises made to the people during the Legislative Assembly election," he added.The Congress-led UDF opposition called Vijayan's statements "pure fraud" and boycotted the session in protest.HOW DID KERALA COMBAT EXTREME POVERTY?With an investment of over Rs 1,000 crore, the state government ensured daily food for 20,648 families, with 2,210 of those receiving hot meals, necessary treatment and medicine for 85,721 individuals and housing for thousands.He said more than 5,400 new homes were built or are under construction, 5,522 homes were repaired and 2,713 landless families received land to build their residences.Besides that, 21,263 people received essential documents like ration cards, Aadhaar and pensions for the first time and 4,394 families are supported with livelihood projects, Vijayan had said in a post."Instead of a one-size-fits-all policy, the government identified 64,006 vulnerable families and created specific micro-plans for each one's unique needs," the Chief Minister had added.Local Self-Government Minister MB Rajesh on Friday said Kerala's Extreme Poverty Eradication Programme (EPEP) had been implemented through a transparent and participatory process involving micro-level projects across the state.The minister said the achievement was the result of coordinated efforts that transcended political boundaries, with participation from local bodies under both the LDF and UDF administrations.Slamming the UDF for opposing the government's initiative, Rajesh said, "It is not as if we suddenly decided one fine morning to announce that Kerala is free from extreme poverty."OPPOSITION BOYCOTTS SPECIAL SESSION, VIJAYAN TAKES DIGAs the special Assembly session commenced for the announcement on Kerala being free from extreme poverty, Leader of Opposition VD Satheesan said the Chief Minister's statement was "pure fraud" and in "contempt" of House rules."So, we cannot join in that and are completely boycotting the session," Satheesan said. The opposition then walked out of the House shouting slogans.Responding to the opposition's allegation, Vijayan said the UDF was referring to its own behaviour when they say "fraud". "We only say what we can implement. We have implemented what we had said. That is our reply to the opposition leader," he said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Bosnia and Herzegovina: The horse whisperer | Focus on Europe</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEvEHKM5S04</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/NEvEHKM5S04?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 07:19:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Lamija Džigal-Bektešević protects Bosnian Mountain Horses and offers riding therapy for people with disabilities.

It just isn’t admitting as much</title><link>https://theconversation.com/europe-is-allowing-itself-to-be-dominated-by-the-us-it-just-isnt-admitting-as-much-267060</link><author>/u/Crossstoney</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 01:51:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For 80 years, Europe maintained an asymmetric yet cooperative relationship with the United States. This imbalance, long accepted as the price of stability and protection, has shifted dramatically under US President Donald Trump. What was once a strategically uneven interdependence has become an unbreakable grip, which is used to exert pressure while being denied by its victims.In my book, l’Atlantisme est mort ? Vive l’Europe ! (Is Atlanticism Dead? Long Live Europe!), I describe this shift by introducing the concept of : a permitted grip in which Europeans, believing themselves to be partners, become dependent on a power that dominates them without their full awareness. does not merely refer to influence or soft power, but an internalised strategic subordination. Europeans justify this dependence in the name of realism, security, or economic stability, without recognising that it structurally weakens them.In Trump’s worldview, Europeans are no longer allies but freeloaders. The common market enabled them to become the world’s largest consumer zone and strengthen their companies’ competitiveness, including in the US market. Meanwhile, through NATO, they let Washington bear the costs of collective defence.The result? According to Trump, the US – because it is strong, generous, and noble – is being “taken advantage of” by its allies. This narrative justifies a shift: allies become resources to exploit. It is no longer cooperation, but extraction.Ukraine as a pressure leverThe war in Ukraine perfectly illustrates this logic. While the EU mobilized to support Kyiv, this solidarity became a vulnerability exploited by Washington. When the Trump administration temporarily suspended Ukrainian access to US intelligence, the Ukrainian army became blind. Europeans, also dependent on this data, were left half-blind.The administration’s move was not a mere tactical adjustment, but a strategic signal: European autonomy is conditional.In July 2025, the EU accepted a deeply unbalanced trade agreement imposing 15% tariffs on its products, without reciprocity. The Turnberry agreement was negotiated at Trump’s private estate in Scotland – a strong symbol of the personalization and brutalization of international relations.At the same time, the US stopped delivering weapons directly to Ukraine. Europeans now buy American-made arms and deliver them themselves to Kyiv. This is no longer partnership, but forced delegation.From partners to tributariesIn the logic of the MAGA movement, which is dominant within the Republican Party, Europe is no longer a partner. At best, it is a client; at worst, a tributary.In this situation, Europeans accept their subordination without naming it. This consent rests on two illusions: the idea that this dependence is the least bad option, and the belief that it is temporary.Yet many European actors – political leaders, entrepreneurs, and industrialists – supported the Turnberry agreement and the intensification of US arms purchases. In 2025, Europe accepted a perverse deal: paying for its political, commercial and budgetary alignment in exchange for uncertain protection.It is a quasi-mafia logic of international relations, based on intimidation, brutalization and the subordination of “partners”. Like Don Corleone in Frances Ford Coppola’s The Godfather, Trump seeks to impose an unpredictable American protection in exchange for an arbitrary price set unilaterally by the US. and imperialism: two logics of dominationIt is essential to distinguish  from other forms of domination. Unlike President Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whose imperialism relies on military violence, Trump’s US does not use direct force. When Trump threatens to annex Greenland, he exerts pressure but does not mobilize troops. He acts through economic coercion, trade blackmail, and political pressure.Because Europeans are partially aware of this and debate the acceptable degree of pressure, this grip is all the more insidious. It is systemic, normalized, and thus hard to contest.Putin’s regime, by contrast, relies on violence as a principle of government – against its own society and its neighbours. The invasion of Ukraine is its culmination. Both systems exercise domination, but through different logics: Russian imperialism is brutal and direct; US  is accepted, constraining, and denied.What makes  particularly dangerous is the denial that accompanies it. Europeans continue to speak of the transatlantic partnership, shared values, and strategic alignment. But the reality is one of accepted coercion.This denial is not only rhetorical: it shapes policies. European leaders justify trade concessions, arms purchases, and diplomatic alignments as reasonable compromises. They hope Trump will pass, that the old balance will return.But  is not a minor development. It is a structural transformation of the transatlantic relationship. And as long as Europe does not name it, it will keep weakening – strategically, economically and politically.Naming  to resist itEurope must open its eyes. The transatlantic link, once protective, has become an instrument of domination. The concept of  allows us to name this reality – and naming is already resisting.The question is now clear: does Europe want to remain a passive subject of US strategy, or become a strategic actor again? The answer will determine its place in tomorrow’s world.A weekly e-mail in English featuring expertise from scholars and researchers.
