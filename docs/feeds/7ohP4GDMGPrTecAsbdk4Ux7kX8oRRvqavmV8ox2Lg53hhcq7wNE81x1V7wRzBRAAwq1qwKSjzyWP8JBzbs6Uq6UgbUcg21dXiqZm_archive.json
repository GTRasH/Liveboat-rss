Anthony explains the role of 'keening women' - once persecuted by the government and the church - who would wail and lament at the graveside (and air any mistakes the deceased may have made) as well as the procession down the 'corpse road' and the customs of covering mirrors and opening the window at the point of death.</p><p>Warning: this episode has an instance of explicit language.</p><p>Produced by Freddy Chick and edited by Matthew Wilson and Dougal Patmore</p>","contentLength":799,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/6901f0801c14e95bd2a32c34/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&sig=nGqd762jCobROBdgmhw--3en6zjUAHoEscGDzLtWmS8","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"What Caused Europe's Witch Hysteria?","url":"https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/what-caused-europes-witch-hysteria","date":1761697800,"author":"","guid":667,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Across early modern Europe, fear spread like wildfire; between the 15th and 17th centuries, tens of thousands were accused, tortured, and executed as witches.
