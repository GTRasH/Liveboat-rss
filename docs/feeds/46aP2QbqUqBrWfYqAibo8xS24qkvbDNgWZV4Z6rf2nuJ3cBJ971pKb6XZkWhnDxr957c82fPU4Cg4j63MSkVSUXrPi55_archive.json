The imagery shows the ship less than 200km away from the coastline of Venezuela.</p><p>USS Iwo Jima is anamphibious assault ship that serves as a core component of US expeditionary forces, capable of launching amphibious invasions.</p><p>USS Iwo Jima was also seen accompanied by two other USS destroyers, within around 20km of each other.</p><p>The ship's arrival follows the announcement that the USS Gerald R Ford Aircraft carrier is also being moved towards the Caribbean Sea, with three US destroyers alongside it.</p><p>Sean Parnell, assistant to the Secretary of War for Public Affairs, said in a statement on X on 24 October that the forces will \"enhance and augment existing capabilities to disrupt narcotics trafficking and degrade and dismantle\" transnational criminal organisations.</p><p>He was thought to be describing fishing boats which they suspected of trafficking drugs, but so far there is no evidence to confirm this.</p><p>The deployment means there will be 14% of the US Navy's fleet in the Caribbean, showing a significant build-up of force.</p><p>USS Gerald R Ford was spotted just off the coast of Italy on its way to the Caribbean on 29 October.</p><p>Mr Cancian, senior advisor of defence and security at the Centre for Strategic International Studies (CSIS), told Sky News: \"The United States only has 11 carriers, three are at sea at any one time. So, moving one of them into the Caribbean is very significant, it does a couple of things. It puts more pressure on the Maduro regime, and it brings a lot of combat power into the Caribbean.\"</p><p>He described the USS Gerald R Ford as a \"use it or lose it\" asset, saying \"it's so powerful and so scarce, carrier strike groups, that other regional commanders will want to use the battle group\".</p><p>He added, when the airstrike carrier arrives in the Caribbean, a decision will have to be made.</p><p>\"If the administration wants to conduct strikes, the arrival of the Ford would open that window for those attacks,\" he said.</p><p>On 30 October, the Wall Street Journal reported that US officials said the Trump administration has identified targets in Venezuela that include military facilities used to smuggle drugs.</p><p><strong>Is the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier the best military asset for targeting drug boats?</strong></p><p>Nick Brown, director at Janes defence intelligence company, told Sky News the \"Gerald R Ford is the US Navy's newest aircraft carrier and the largest warship currently in US service\".</p><p>He said there are 4,805 crew members on board and a full range of precision air-to-surface bombs, missiles and rockets, \"able to tackle a wide variety of tactical and strategic targets\".</p><p>The aircraft carrier also carries an abundance of fighter jets, typically 24 F/A-18s and 24 F-35s.</p><p>Mr Cancian said: \"It's not a very good asset for countering drug traffic. The strike aircraft are very powerful, but they move too fast to identify small boats. There are some helicopters that could help, but what the carrier is very good at is attacks against adversary military forces or targets ashore.</p><p>\"The strike aircraft operate at 500, 600mph. So, they're going very fast.
