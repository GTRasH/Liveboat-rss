In this episode, he calls out how proprietary BI tools quietly lock companies into their ecosystems, making data less open and less useful. David and Demetrios debate whether semantic layers should live in open-source hands and how AI agents might soon replace entire chunks of manual data engineering. From feature stores to LLM-driven analytics, this conversation challenges how we think about ownership, access, and the future of data workflows.</p><p>Experienced and world-renowned data, technology, and AI leader.

In this episode, Marco Palladino, CTO and co-founder of Kong Inc., explores what it means to build and scale AI responsibly when the rulebook is still being written. He explains that infrastructure should be the frontline defense for enforcing governance, security, and reliability in AI deployments. Marco shares how Kong’s technologies, including AI Gateway and AI Manager, help organizations rein in shadow AI, reduce LLM hallucinations, improve observability, and act as the foundation for agentic workflows.</p><p>Marco Palladino is an inventor, software developer, and internet entrepreneur. As the CTO and co-founder of Kong, he is Kong’s co-author, responsible for the design and delivery of the company’s products, while also providing technical thought leadership around APIs and microservices within both Kong and the external software community. Prior to Kong, Marco co-founded Mashape in 2010, which became the largest API marketplace and was acquired by RapidAPI in 2017. </p><p>~~~~~~~~ ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ ~~~~~~~</p><p>[00:00] Agent-mediated interactions shift</p><p>[01:17] Kong connectivity and agents</p><p>[04:36] Transcript cleanup request</p><p>[08:11] MCP server use cases</p><p>[12:37] Agent world possibilities </p><p>[15:55] Business communication evolution</p><p>[18:55] System optimization</p><p>[25:36] AI gateway patterns</p><p>[31:30] Investment decision making</p><p>[35:54] Building conviction process</p><p>[41:34] Polished customer conversation</p><p>[46:37] AI gateway R&amp;D future</p>","contentLength":1693,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/109336174/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-9-7%2F408822893-44100-2-72697f8780dfb.mp3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Best AI Hackathon Project Ever?
