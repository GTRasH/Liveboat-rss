People are just used to it. </p><p>But in Go it requires a bit more work. Before 1.20 there wasn't even a way to record why a context was canceled. The context might be cancelled because the client bailed, or because the task actually succeeded and the deferred cancel just ran.</p><p>Recording the context cancellation reason requires some song &amp; dance.

The companies that installed CCTV systems for us in our datacenters frequently left the default credentials, and forgot to communicate them to us. My team was working on a remote system to centralize recordings/live streams worldwide and trigger computer-vision alerts, and we regularly wasted time chasing installers for credentials and access details.</p><p>At the time I wrote Cameradar to scan our datacenter networks, <strong>detect cameras, try known/default credentials</strong>, and then use those to access the control panel so we could properly configure and integrate devices into our system.</p><p>It became popular quickly after I rewrote it from C++ to Go, and over the years I’ve rewritten major parts multiple times.</p><p>I took a long break from open source for personal reasons, and recently came back.
