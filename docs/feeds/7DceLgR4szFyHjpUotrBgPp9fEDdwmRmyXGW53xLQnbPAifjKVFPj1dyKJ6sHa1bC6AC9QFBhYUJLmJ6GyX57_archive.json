He says he wants something, adds it to a list somewhere, and eventually forgets why he wanted it.</p> <p>Well, I got him one of his listed items for Christmas! It was this thing: - AiTrip EEPROM BIOS USB Programmer CH341A + SOIC8 Clip + 1.8V Adapter + SOIC8 Adapter for 24 25 Series Flash</p> <p>I casually brought up a BIOS USB programmer, and he said he’s not sure what he’d use such a thing for.</p> <p>He’s into programming, data engineering, and Linux. He has several old computers laying around as a sort of “homelab” thing. Any idea what he might have wanted that for? I worry he’s going to open his present and have no memory of why he originally wanted this thing. It would be nice if I could give him cool ideas in that moment—but I literally have no idea.</p> <p>Can anyone help? What stuff does a BIOS USB programmer usually gets techy guys excited about? </p> <p>EDIT: He initially added it to his wishlist just to have it with the hope to eventually have a reason to use it and justify its purchase. However, he had not thought of how it could help us reprogram/flash the school provided laptop that had restrictions so that was helpful! He’s still looking forward to any other opportunities, like the other comments, to come up. So, thank you to everyone who commented and helped out! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/IntuitiveMotherhood\"> /u/IntuitiveMotherhood </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hma07a/what_would_my_husband_want_a_bios_usb_programmer/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hma07a/what_would_my_husband_want_a_bios_usb_programmer/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Lets Be Real About Dependencies","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hm52gq/lets_be_real_about_dependencies/","date":1735148233,"author":"/u/Alexander_Selkirk","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"&#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Alexander_Selkirk\"> /u/Alexander_Selkirk </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://wiki.alopex.li/LetsBeRealAboutDependencies\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hm52gq/lets_be_real_about_dependencies/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Installing Linux for the first time ever on this...
