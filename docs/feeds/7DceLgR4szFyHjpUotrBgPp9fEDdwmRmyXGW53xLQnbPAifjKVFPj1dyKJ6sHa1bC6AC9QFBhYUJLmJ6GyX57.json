This extends at first to the\nRust compiler and standard library, and the Sequoia ecosystem.\n\nIn particular, our code to parse .deb, .ar, .tar, and the\nHTTP signature verification code would strongly benefit\nfrom memory safe languages and a stronger approach to\nunit testing.\n\nIf you maintain a port without a working Rust toolchain,\nplease ensure it has one within the next 6 months, or\nsunset the port.\n\nIt's important for the project as whole to be able to\nmove forward and rely on modern tools and technologies\nand not be held back by trying to shoehorn modern software\non retro computing devices.\n\nThank you for your understanding.\n-- \ndebian developer - deb.li/jak | jak-linux.org - free software dev\nubuntu core developer                              i speak de, en\n</pre>","contentLength":874,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1olq11f/hard_rust_requirements_from_may_onward/"},{"title":"i'm a zoomer on cachyOS but it seems to run in the family; my father has a jacket with a sun microsystems embroider on the front","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1olp7wt/im_a_zoomer_on_cachyos_but_it_seems_to_run_in_the/","date":1762007332,"author":"/u/bonzibuddy_official","guid":625,"unread":true,"content":"<p>he's mentioned having a good amount of experience in red hat mostly for his career, we ended up finding this in storage recently. it also has another larger embroidery of the java logo on the back. it's comfortable and fits me still which also rocks. </p><p>i started using linux (mint) around 2021/2022 for hobbyist and general purposes, had to mostly run windows for college using adobe, no longer doing all of that so i'm back on cachy since it seems promising enough for an arch derivative. </p><p>thought this would be neat to share on here. thank you unix for being the foundation for the funny little penguin kernal that's sure to sweep any year now :P</p>","contentLength":645,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Python refuses $1.5M grant, Unity's in trouble, AUR attacked again - Linux Weekly News","url":"https://tilvids.com/videos/watch/02a038db-fdd0-46d4-8cb2-1f0b1b0bd04d","date":1761998909,"author":"/u/Pure_Toe6636","guid":627,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1olm6jp/python_refuses_15m_grant_unitys_in_trouble_aur/"},{"title":"Well a old school flex i guess","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1olftbt/well_a_old_school_flex_i_guess/","date":1761974186,"author":"/u/Puzzleheaded-Car4883","guid":624,"unread":true,"content":"<p>This old Red Hat Linux 8.0 manual’s been gathering dust on my shelf.
