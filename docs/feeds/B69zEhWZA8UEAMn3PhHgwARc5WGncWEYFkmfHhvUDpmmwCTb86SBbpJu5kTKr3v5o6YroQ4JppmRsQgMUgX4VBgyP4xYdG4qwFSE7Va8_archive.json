The incidents mark the first time targets in or near Oman have been hit following a wave of retaliatory strikes by Tehran on Gulf states after joint U.S.-Israeli attacks on Iran that have plunged the region into a new war.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nReuters confirmed the identity of the vessel as Skylight by its deck shape, paint, and signage, which matched file imagery. The exact time when the video was filmed could not be independently verified. However, Oman's maritime security center said that Skylight was attacked about five nautical miles off Oman's Musandam on March 1. Ship tracking data puts the vessel off the coast of Oman on March 1.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n#iran #oman #oil #tanker #sanctions</article>","contentLength":851,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/-gDCRz-IVWA?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Passengers stranded during Middle East conflict","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MImFdSD1MC0","date":1772378233,"author":"Reuters","guid":584,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Passengers were stranded worldwide after US and Israeli strikes on Iran and Iranian missile retaliation triggered sweeping Middle East airspace closures.\n\n#News #Reuters #Newsfeed #israeliranwar #iran #middleeast \n\nRead the story here: https://reut.rs/3ZZShqe\n\n👉  Subscribe: http://smarturl.it/reuterssubscribe\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https://www.reuters.com/\nFollow Reuters on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/reuters/?hl=en</article>","contentLength":577,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/MImFdSD1MC0?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"LIVE: Iranians in Berlin celebrate at Brandenburg Gate","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyEDDKEWmLo","date":1772377702,"author":"Reuters","guid":583,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Berlin police expect up to 5,000 Iranians in German exile and their supporters to celebrate the death of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who was killed in a U.S.-Israeli attack.\n\n#Iran #Berlin #Germany #BrandenburgGate #Khamenei \n#live #Reuters #News\n&nbsp;\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https://www.reuters.com/</article>","contentLength":337,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/nyEDDKEWmLo?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Passengers stranded during Middle East conflict","url":"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/_Flsfk6eZkw","date":1772376470,"author":"Reuters","guid":582,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Tourists with flights bound for the Middle Eastern airspaces were stranded, a day after U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran and Iranian missile retaliation rippled through the region, unleashing one of the most severe disruptions to global aviation in years.\n \n#travel #airport #iran #usa #flight\n\n👉  Subscribe: http://smarturl.it/reuterssubscribe\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https://www.reuters.com/\nFollow Reuters on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/reuters/?hl=en</article>","contentLength":611,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/_Flsfk6eZkw?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Iran's Supreme Leader is dead.
