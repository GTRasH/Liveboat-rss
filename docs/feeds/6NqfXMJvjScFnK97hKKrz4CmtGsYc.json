Photo: Priit Simson / Delfi Meedia</p></div><p><strong>Let’s start with a trivia question. Faith, hope, love, peace, anxiety, or victory? Which of these words best characterizes the emotional world of Russian society?</strong></p><p>One can probably find matches for all keywords, but I think the word ‘anxiety’ characterizes it most generally. Russian people are increasingly asking where is this much and long promised victory. They probably see difficulties related to their subsistence and many are worried about the future. But there are many words characterizing Russian society that were not in your list: indifference, switching off, brainwashing.</p><p><strong>I am glad that I am interviewing the right person. Readers of the bookstore “Читай-город” (Chitai-gorod) overwhelmingly chose “anxiety” as the Russian word of the year. How can anxiety express itself in such a closed and repressive society?</strong></p><p>For the majority, it expresses itself in dealing with other things. They don’t think big or socially. It certainly expresses itself in self-censorship. In many ways, Russia has long been back in the Soviet era. The only question is whether it is the year 1937 or 1984, meaning whether it will get even worse or if the bottom has been reached and perestroika will come.</p><p>I do not predict perestroika in the near future today. At the same time, all pivotal events in Russia have occurred with a short fuse. Working in intelligence and making forecasts has made me very cautious, and especially regarding Russia, I wouldn’t make long forecasts, but no ray of optimism shines there. Brains have left, people are full of violence. They are willing to turn a blind eye to whatever evil.</p><p>The hope is that if at one moment Russian people have to choose between the television and the refrigerator, the refrigerator will win. If there is nothing left in the refrigerator, people might suddenly come to the streets and that is the end of this regime. I certainly hope for Putin’s end. Whoever comes after him, a time of confusion will follow. Russia’s attention will certainly be on internal problems for some time, and this is not pleasant for any dictatorship. There will certainly not be any natural selection where someone simply takes over Putin’s place.</p><p><strong>How does the Kremlin itself understand this and how much does Putin’s gang monitor what is happening in society?</strong></p><p>The Kremlin monitors societal processes and moods very keenly. It micromanages what happens in Russia at the most local level. The Kremlin receives real-time overviews of what is happening in local municipalities, settlements. Every dictatorship is worried about losing control and therefore uses surveillance methods.</p><p>We know that the Kremlin is very worried about how to mitigate potential tensions with likely radicalized or disappointed men returning from the war. The Kremlin and FSB monitor these developments very keenly, including all sorts of religious movements, for example neo-paganism. Russia cannot control such things like it controls the Orthodox Church. Russia lacks the capacity to deal with such fundamental problems. Hundreds of thousands of men will come demanding prostheses, demanding hero status, maybe sweet positions. A separate topic is the proliferation of weapons after the war.</p><p>All that alcoholism, PTSD – Russia simply is not ready to deal with this. We see what the level of Russian healthcare is. Thus I forecast that the end of the war will be difficult for Russia.</p><p><strong>So the end of the war and the possible gradual lifting of sanctions would not mean a certain liberation for Russia?</strong></p><p>It might create short-term euphoria for a moment. Maybe the economy even goes up a few percent. But this of course depends on the details, to what extent sanctions go off and on what conditions the war ends. In the long run, Russia faces fundamental problems, primarily related to the economy.</p><p><strong>You mentioned impoverishment. Such a word is not really used about the conditions prevailing in Russia so far. Rather, the conventional wisdom says that sanctions have not had a visible impact on the ordinary person’s life. True, over the last half year there have been more danger signs hanging over the Russian economy, but not impoverishment.</strong>\nThe ordinary person’s income is largely at the same level as it was around the year 2010. This means 15 years of stagnation. But let’s look at the future. What are Russia’s perspectives? Essentially, it is increasingly an economy under China’s control, a raw material warehouse. They have oil, gas, rare earth metals and other metals, but Russia cannot produce anything [meaningful] itself or create new quality. If we leave the war industry aside, then how to cope in the competition of international economy, where keywords are AI, smart technologies, international interaction on scientific level? In this big game, Russia has moved backward a lot in recent years. I don’t see that anything would get better for Russia. Oil price forecasts are rather downward. Their liquid reserves are essentially out.</p><p><strong>Which of those same nominees for Russia’s word of the year characterizes Estonian society the most?</strong></p><p>I think anxiety as well. It is persistent. It is inherent to us, we are a small nation and live next to a serial killer neighbor. Maybe it is also a force motivating us to act. But on the other hand, it is also a factor eating our confidence and exhausting us.</p><p><strong>How often do your friends ask you when will the war start?</strong></p><p>Very often. It happens a lot and I am depressed that there is so much of this anxiety. I am also anxious about Ukraine and at times depressed by the news, but regarding our own security we could be significantly more confident. This doesn’t mean that everything is fine and the end of history has arrived. Putin’s Russia needs constant monitoring, we must constantly validate our assumptions. But the “is Narva next” questions are indeed frustrating.</p><p><strong>What do you tell your friends who ask when the war starts?</strong></p><p>A conventional war against Estonia is not very likely in the near future for various reasons. But we must prepare for it, because we live next to a sick and by nature aggressive state.</p><p>First, everything I know about Russia’s thinking, Russia’s vision of the world, Russia’s intent, and war against the Baltics does not figure there. I do not know that there is currently or has been in recent years an intent to militarily attack the Baltics. We are in NATO. NATO, last I checked, is still operating. Russia takes Article 5 seriously.</p><p>We see every day how Russia actually very consciously calibrates how far it goes with certain things. For example, if we take the ongoing sabotage campaign. Certain things are sort of okay for Russia, but certain things are not.</p><p><strong>What for example is not okay regarding sabotage?</strong></p><p>Terror attacks with large civilian casualties. For example against passenger planes, which sort of was on the table. When Western intelligence found out about this and escalated it to the political level, this thing was put on hold [in the Kremlin], because it was understood that this is playing with fire.</p><p>Here is also a paradox. General top-down orders are characteristic of the Russian system and then some officials with lower than average IQ carry out these orders and sometimes improvise in hopes of doing favors for the Czar. Due to which mistakes can happen and this is dangerous. With Russia one must always be on guard.</p><p>The biggest danger for us is a miscalculation in Moscow. As is known, they also miscalculated in Ukraine, although Putin has wanted Ukraine back from day one. Estonia does not belong to the so-called Russian world (). We are not part of this core Russia for Putin or his inner circle like Ukraine or Belarus are. Russia currently lacks the intention to occupy part of the Baltics, but this may change in time. So I always emphasize the temporal definition, because it is also the task of intelligence to check and validate these assumptions every day.</p><p>The second reason is our NATO membership and thirdly the Ukraine war, which is a limiting factor for Russia. Russia has completely tied itself militarily to the Ukraine direction. Even when the war ends, a considerable part of the Russian army will likely remain tied to Ukraine. So any military attack involving many risks against NATO, for example in the Baltics, would likely force Russia to free up very large resources from elsewhere. It is not like the Pskov 76th Air Assault division will get an order and it’s done. There are very many things that can go wrong.</p><p><strong>At the same time, throughout the last year we have read and heard countless claims to the contrary from Europe, Ukraine, and even the U.S. Chancellor Merz talks about how Putin’s goal is to restore the Soviet Union. Budanov says that Putin will not stop with Ukraine and so on. Again, different experts have started putting a year number on when Russia will attack or be ready to attack the Baltics.</strong></p><p>Often what Western intelligence says about Russia’s capability relies on the assumption that the war with Ukraine will end and Russia achieves its goals there. Russia has so far not achieved any of its major goals in Ukraine. So these are hypothetical scenarios, but primarily in terms of forecasting capability. Often no distinction is made between intent and capability.</p><p>Indeed there have been different statements in the media, but it is not my business to comment on them. I know that Estonian intelligence assessments of the Russian threat do not differ from the assessments of our most capable intelligence partners.</p><p>Regarding the statements of Ukrainian intelligence leaders about the Baltics not only this year, but also earlier, these are largely caused by the desire to create an attitude of certain urgency or acuteness in the West, which would make them deal with Russia more forcefully. So we are a bit like collateral damage.</p><p>The statements of Western politicians and intelligence services are often related to addressing domestic audiences. For example in the case of Germany, with the desire to create some resonance in society for example to increase defense spending. The Baltics is a convenient example to use. The media is also to blame, which amplifies and sometimes takes things out of context to create a shinier headline.</p><p><strong>On the last day of 2025, another ship carrying Russian cargo cut the undersea cables between Estonia and Finland. Estonian security agencies have held the position that all these incidents have not been organized by Russian intelligence. Why do you assess so?</strong></p><p>One should ask the security agencies, but I will say this much, that it is likely in Russia’s interests to keep the Baltic Sea as problem-free and navigable as possible, since their export, as well as connections with Kaliningrad, depend on the stability of the Baltic Sea.</p><p>Every such incident brings new calls for restrictive actions regarding the shadow and other fleets, NATO missions, sanctions. Looking strategically, Moscow doesn’t need this mess. At the same time,&nbsp;&nbsp;(disorder/mess) also characterizes Russia, due to which one cannot always rule out a situation where one hand doesn’t know what the other is doing.</p><p>My strong assessment is that predominantly the Baltic Sea incidents of recent years have been caused by a coincidence of circumstances – significantly larger shipping traffic in the Russian direction, vessels in poor condition and crews with low professionalism, more underwater infrastructure than before, greater public attention. Broken anchor devices cut underwater cables in stormy conditions earlier as well, but these incidents weren’t talked about. At the same time, the longer the West collectively allows the shadow fleet to rally on the Baltic Sea, the more likely it is only a question of time when the next thing happens.</p><p><strong>There has recently been a lot of talk about Europe and NATO needing to start paying Russia back regarding sabotage and take counter-activities to Russian territory. Most recently, for example, the head of the NATO Military Committee Giuseppe Dragone presented such a line of thought. Is this a realistic plan?</strong></p><p>This is talking about something that should be obvious. Why talk about it at all. If Russia is in a so-called hybrid war against us, then it seems reasonable to stand against it. One part of standing against it is also offensive activity.</p><p><strong>Maybe these statements are also part of this same search for confidence that the US reproaches us for?</strong></p><p>Agreed. After all, a large part of Europe continues to live in the hope that these problems will just disappear. I subscribe to America’s reprimanding attitude towards Europe, especially regarding defense spending.</p><p><strong>Why don’t we have this confidence in Estonia?</strong></p><p>This stems from our smallness and history, but is clearly also linked to international developments on the other side of the ocean, which has made people more anxious. Being now in Israel, which is one of the most self-confident societies of all, I think that without it, it is hard to survive. You have to believe in yourself, in your friends, and be ready to act.</p><p><strong>But Europe is not small neither geographically nor in terms of population. 450 million people live in the EU. The economy is many times larger than Russia’s. What explains the lack of confidence in Estonian society cannot explain the same in Europe.</strong></p><p>From our view the situation is not perfect. Europe often does not speak with one voice. This cacophony is written into EU’s architecture. Unfortunately there are also member states who work against it. But let’s rewind ourselves back to February 2022. Would anyone have predicted that now four years later we are working out the 20th sanctions package, tightening the screw all the time? Yes, in our assessment things take too long and are at times full of exceptions and gaps, but in the big picture relative unanimity and readiness to support Ukraine prevail.</p><p><strong>In the Russian word of the year competition, </strong><strong>&nbsp;was also put to a vote. Put into an endearing-sarcastic form, that term roughly translates as a secret agreement, a reference to negotiations going on through US mediation. Why is Russian society so sarcastic regarding these negotiations?</strong></p><p>Sarcasm is inherent to Russian society in general. It comes from the Soviet time, that one cannot believe everything the mass media says. I think that currently the attitude is simply widespread that one cannot actually negotiate with the West, one cannot trust the West. Therefore they are skeptical regarding all sorts of agreements. The West is conversely just as skeptical [towards Russia].</p><p><strong>How would you analyze the current negotiations?</strong></p><p>It is hard for me to comment because I don’t know the latest status, but it seems a kind of round game is going on. We have already been in this place before, where through the words of the US president it was said that a breakthrough is expected any moment. We have also heard before that Putin wants peace. In actions we do not see this in any way. I am skeptical regarding any significant breakthrough in the coming months. At the same time the situation for Ukraine could also be much worse, so the glass is simultaneously half full and half empty.</p><p><strong>The Wall Street Journal published recently how it was Putin who lured Steve Witkoff to be the US chief negotiator and that this chain went through Saudi Arabia. Why did the Kremlin need specifically a man like Witkoff to negotiate and not for example Secretary of State Marco Rubio?</strong></p><p>Witkoff declares that he is a master of deal making and open to deals. Russia certainly uses different levers very cunningly in negotiations and one of the biggest levers is all sorts of flatteries, promises for deals and other benefits accompanying it. I very much hope that Western negotiators see through this. Russia has certainly consciously looked for such dealmakers.</p><p><strong>On the other hand Russia itself has now replaced the pseudo-historian Vladimir Medinsky with Kirill Dmitriev, who similarly lacks any diplomatic background, but in other regards is perhaps more credible.</strong></p><p>Dmitriev has a US background, he has lived in the US. Dmitriev himself has also been very interested in being in this role. I think Putin uses him as long as needed and at one moment, when his contribution is no longer useful, he will be pushed aside. Dmitriev is another pawn, he is certainly not any decider in the Russian system. His coming into this game has created competition in other Russian players as well. It is inherent to Putin to use different levers and wait who brings a better result, and at the same time keep all options open.</p><p><strong>Q: Witkoff is a dealmaker and ready for deals, but it seems to me that the US and Russia are pursuing very different things in negotiations. Trump, Witkoff, Jared Kushner want a deal, be it financial or business, and Putin exploits this. Putin himself, however, proceeds from an ideological strategy and one of establishing “historical truth”.</strong></p><p>I think you are right. For a large part of today’s US administration, Russia’s war in Ukraine is an unpleasant distraction that should be packed up quickly to deal with main topics, be they South America or China topics.</p><p><strong>Does Putin also want to make a deal?</strong></p><p>Putin wants a deal on his own terms. For him control over Ukraine seems to be an existential question of his legacy in Russian history. Ukraine is a topic that has passionately captivated Putin for over 20 years. Putin is not any historian, but already since the late 1990s he seems to believe that Russia cannot restore its greatness without controlling Ukraine and Belarus. These three countries form the so-called core Russia for him. When Putin talks about Russia’s greatness and growth, about Russia’s borders, then he primarily means these three.</p><p>This war is not about Donbas or the Crimea land connection. For Putin this war is still about control over Kyiv. Kyiv does not necessarily have to be conquered for this, but a pro-Russian government must be installed. Currently this does not seem doable from any angle. Ukraine has shed too much blood for this.</p><p><strong>Especially if as a result of whatever negotiations Ukraine should give up Donbas or some part of unconquered territory?</strong></p><p>Maybe it would mean a pause in the war, but not the end of it. It is a separate question on what conditions this pause would arise for Russia, what happens to sanctions, what happens to demobilized soldiers. As much as the Western intelligence community knows, Putin has not given up on his goals. He has likely corrected his timeframes, but there are no references that he has given up on his final goal. The good news is that the final goal does not look significantly closer to Russia than it was four years ago.</p><p><strong>How long will Russia last and how long will Ukraine last, assuming a peace treaty will not be agreed on?</strong></p><p>Very hard to say. If new forceful sanctions were to hit Russia, Russia’s resilience would be more fragile. If some economic cataclysm were to happen in the world that brings oil prices down, Russia’s resilience will be more fragile. Or a natural catastrophe that directs attention and resources elsewhere. There are more and more of these possibilities.</p><p>In Ukraine’s case there are fewer of these possibilities, since Ukraine has been in a very difficult state for a sufficiently long time. Ukraine’s problem is primarily a shortage of personnel, but I do not see signs that Ukraine would be ready to give up. Because they know what the alternative is. They have no choice. As long as at least European support remains, and it seems to me that a very large part of Europe is still and strongly behind Ukraine, then I think Ukraine will hold out. This does not mean that it is easy for them or that they will not lose more territory.</p><p><strong>Besides the question of conceding territory, the other important chapter of the negotiations is about security guarantees to Ukraine. What basis is there to even believe and assume the validity of such agreements in case the guarantee will need to be activated?</strong></p><p>Doubt regarding the validity of agreements and promises has likely grown, but whether this mistrust has now taken over completely, I am not sure. Among other things, I think, for example, that Russia continues to consider NATO Article 5 valid and does not wish to test it at the moment. As for Ukraine’s security guarantees, the key question is whether the guarantors are ready to go to war with Russia for Ukraine’s security. This is a black-and-white question. If the answer is yes, then the guarantees are credible.</p><p><strong>My question targets Europe at least as much as the US. You said that today there is great support for Ukraine. But if we look a few years ahead, which elections are coming up in various European countries and which parties might come to power, then I do not have confidence that any guarantee or agreement regarding Russia would hold.</strong></p><p>Regarding Article 5, it does not seem to me that President Trump would want to go down in history as the president during whose time Article 5, and consequently NATO, lost its credibility, its functionality, and is thrown into the trash bin of history. Trump does not seem to me to be a politician who would want to be a loser. He wants to be a winner. I think Russia sees him that way too. Considering also the moods in the Congress, the moods of the American society and its political establishment, which are generally, to put it mildly, critical of Russia, I do not see why an American president would somehow want to go down in history [as the destroyer of NATO]. The situation is of course dynamic and maybe in a year there will be some other winds blowing.</p><p><strong>A month ago, the US confirmed a new National Security Strategy. It contains statements about Europe’s civilizational erasure, lack of self-confidence in relations with Russia, and so on. How tragically should we take the NSS?</strong></p><p>Lack of self-confidence is of course a correct diagnosis. I am not the ambassador to the US and it is not my place to give assessments, but it simply seems to me that during Trump’s time, any strategy document does not possess the value it would have at some other time. It is not characteristic of Trump to act within the framework of strategies written up by officials. This document was likely written in a relatively short time by a handful of people. Also, the entire communication of this document was different than before, which makes one ask how programmatic or strategic it actually is. It is full of slogans characteristic of the MAGA movement. My personal opinion is that we should not pay very much attention to this strategy.</p><p><strong>The other document, adopted a bit later, is the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which does not come from the White House, but from the Congress. The NDAA seems to me to be much more optimistic, precisely in the part concerning Europe, Estonia and the Baltic states.</strong></p><p>Yes, the Baltics are the benchmark of good allies from Washington’s view. Estonia generally has a good image in Washington. We say what we do and we do what we say. We don’t go around whining, but also offer solutions ourselves. All this ties in with the new winds in Washington. The fact that American financial aid for Baltic defense investments was cemented is certainly an important milestone.</p><p><strong>Compared to before, the funding earmarked for the Baltic Security Initiative is even growing.</strong></p><p>I would recommend taking note of this fact to many of those who are extremely worried about America’s stance in Europe. I am not one of those who would be declaring the end of NATO. Yes, NATO is probably neither the most urgent nor the most popular topic for Washington policy makers at the moment, but in a few years we may again be in a situation where NATO will again be very topical in Washington as well, for example due to China. It is not known to me that there would be an intention in Moscow to test NATO in connection with America’s new administration or alleged weakness. On the contrary, I think that the unpredictability characteristic of Trump and the readiness to use military force in various places in the world has made Russia somewhat more concerned.</p><div><div><a href=\"https://vsquare.org/author/hroonemaa/\"></a><p>Head of the investigative desk at Delfi Estonia, Holger Roonemaa has extensively investigated topics related to national security, including Russia’s espionage, interference, and influence operations in Estonia and the wider region.

Now prosecutors also wish to charge him under a law that makes it a criminal offence to “publicly and contrary to the facts deny” Nazi or communist crimes.</p><p>“There is and will be no consent to distorting history and breaking the law,” wrote justice minister Waldemar Żurek, announcing on Friday that he had asked the European Parliament to lift Braun’s immunity.</p><p>“This is a question of historical truth, respect for the victims, and accountability for one’s words,” added Żurek, who also serves as prosecutor general. “The Polish state has a duty to respond to the denial of Nazi-German crimes.”</p><p>Żurek revealed that the accusation against Braun relates to “denial of genocide crimes committed by functionaries of the Third Reich in the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp and the Lublin concentration camp (Majdanek)”.</p><p>In a further statement, Poland’s Institute of National Remembrance (IPN), a state historical body that has prosecutorial power, said that the accusation related to the use of gas chambers at those two camps.</p><p>Neither the IPN nor Żurek confirmed what specific words Braun had said that prompted the planned charges against him. However, the IPN noted that they had come at a live event broadcast online on 27 September 2025.</p><p>On that date, Braun took part in a discussion with Jan Żaryn, a right-wing historian and former senator for the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, titled “The Polish Underground State and the Jewish Issue”. A&nbsp;recording of the event is still available online.</p><p>During his remarks, Braun referred to the “fake gas chambers of Majdanek and Auschwitz”, calling them “a dark, monstrous fantasy that has no satisfactory historical or academic support”.</p><p>He suggested that the idea of the gas chambers had been invented as part of “propaganda and black PR operations conducted by the Soviet and Anglo-Saxon security services during World War Two”, and that the false claim continues to be exploited by Jews today.</p><p>In actual fact, historians estimate that around 900,000 people were killed in the gas chambers at Auschwitz. The vast majority were Jews, but victims also included Roma, Soviet prisoners of war, and ethnic Poles.</p><p>Meanwhile, gas chambers at Majdanek were used to kill tens of thousands, again mainly Jews. Today, the ashes of the camp’s cremated victims are preserved in a memorial at the site of the former camp.</p><p>Braun, who has a long history of promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories, has repeatedly sought to cast doubt on the veracity of Nazi crimes against Jews.</p><p>In a separate interview in July last year, he also <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/07/10/polish-far-right-leader-declares-auschwitz-gas-chambers-to-be-fake/\">called</a> the gas chambers at Auschwitz “fake”. In response, Żurek <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/09/05/poland-asks-eu-parliament-to-strip-far-right-leader-of-immunity-over-holocaust-denial-charges/\">filed a similar request</a> to lift Braun’s immunity so that he could face charges for denying Nazi crimes.</p><p>The European Parliament – which can strip an MEP’s immunity by a majority vote among their fellow MEPs – is still processing that request.</p><p>In December, Braun <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/08/trial-of-polish-far-right-leader-for-attacking-jewish-celebration-in-parliament-begins/\">went on trial</a> over a separate set of charges relating to four other incidents, including his <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2023/12/12/far-right-mp-expelled-from-polish-parliament-after-spraying-hanukkah-candles-with-fire-extinguisher/\">attack</a> on a celebration of the Jewish festival of Hanukkah in parliament in December 2023 and his <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2023/05/31/far-right-mp-forces-abandonment-of-holocaust-scholars-lecture-at-german-institute-in-warsaw/\">disruption of a lecture</a> by a Holocaust scholar.</p><p>“I am standing before this court because I dared to defend myself against oppression and the ritual manifestation of Jewish supremacy,” declared Braun at the start of the trial.</p><p>In November, the European Parliament <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/13/polish-far-right-leader-braun-again-stripped-of-legal-immunity-by-european-parliament/\">also stripped Braun of immunity</a>&nbsp;to face charges for six alleged crimes, including inciting religious hatred against Jews, assaulting a doctor involved in carrying out a late-term abortion, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/03/20/police-investigating-far-right-presidential-candidates-vandalism-of-lgbt-exhibition-in-poland/\">vandalising</a>&nbsp;an LGBT+ exhibition.</p><p>Amid his legal troubles, Braun has seen his popularity rise.

And all of this will be done remotely, from the US. With BTW being the local term for VAT, Hubert calls the current situation “BTW-as-a-service” due to the lack of control.</p><p>The “turnkey solution” as described in the tender includes equipment, system software, configuration, maintenance, and management. The new solution will also have access to 20 to 25 other applications within the Tax and Customs Administration. It is unclear exactly which ones these are; they could be purchased systems or locally developed applications (LOAs).</p><p>Given that the tender process has been ongoing for years, it is clear that the choice of an American IT supplier was made without knowledge of the current geopolitical tensions. Criticism has been coming from various quarters, logically including competitors for the tender, for some time now. However, the Tax and Customs Administration is said to have ensured that it runs independently within the Netherlands, although concrete evidence of the complete autonomy of the purchased system is not yet available.</p><p>The alternative would have been SAPTRM from SAP, implemented by Capgemini, which is well known to the tax authorities. A 2022 report by McKinsey compared this solution with that of FAST Enterprises, but it is now offline. In it, the latter solution, which was ultimately chosen, would have emerged as the winner.</p><p>According to the ICT Assessment Advisory Board, the preparations for this transition were insufficient in <a href=\"https://www.adviescollegeicttoetsing.nl/documenten/2024/04/02/bit-advies-modernisering-omzetbelasting\" target=\"_blank\">April 2024</a>. The management was said to have been too weak, the need for the solution insufficiently clear, and above all, the preparation for the decision-making process was deemed ‘insufficiently careful’. In <a href=\"https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/details?id=ECLI:NL:RBDHA:2025:3645\" target=\"_blank\">March 2025</a>, the court ruled that the award to FAST was justified after Capgemini had filed a lawsuit.</p><p>The acquisition of Solvinity by the American company Kyndryl sparked the controversy surrounding digital sovereignty at the beginning of this year. Because <a href=\"https://www.techzine.eu/news/privacy-compliance/138159/regulator-investigates-kyndryls-acquisition-of-dutch-solvinity/\">Solvinity</a> manages the DigiD system for civil affairs on behalf of the government, dependence on the United States via the former IBM component Kyndryl would be risky. Exactly how much control Washington has is unclear, especially since the outsourcing of DigiD may eventually be relocated.</p><p>In short, what is now happening with FAST Enterprises seems to be repeating the controversy surrounding Solvinity. Although the details are completely different, the importance of the government’s digital autonomy remains at stake. The expressed concerns about decision-making and the lack of transparency about the exact control exercised by the Tax and Customs Administration make the issue highly debatable. This is clear even without the knowledge of 2026.</p>","contentLength":3452,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1rhr0lt/dutch_tax_authority_hands_us_software_company/"},{"title":"Germany’s AfD sparks fears it is helping Russia with inquiry on NATO weaknesses","url":"https://www.politico.eu/article/afd-inquiry-nato-vulnerabilities-hedgehog-2025-estonia-raises-intelligence-fears/","date":1772342709,"author":"/u/andrewgrabowski","guid":346,"unread":true,"content":"<div><p>“This isn’t a political quarrel.

Security Council on Saturday where the U.N. chief and many countries urged a halt to  and a return to negotiations to prevent the conflict from spreading further into the region and beyond.</p><p>Secretary-General António Guterres told the council that everything must be done to prevent an escalation. “The alternative,” he warned, “is a potential wider conflict with grave consequences for civilians and regional stability.”</p><p>Guterres said the U.S. and Israeli airstrikes violated international law, including the U.N. Charter. He also condemned Iran’s retaliatory attacks for violating the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bahrain, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Mike Waltz, insisted the U.S. military action was lawful. </p><p>“Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon,” he told the council. “That principle is not a matter of politics. It’s a matter of global security. And to that end, the United States is taking lawful actions.”</p><p>Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon defended the airstrikes as necessary to stop an existential threat.</p><p>“We are stopping extremism before it becomes unstoppable,” he said. “We will ensure that no radical regime armed with nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles can threaten our people or the entire world.”</p><p>Amir Saeid Iravani, Iran’s ambassador to the U.N., told the council that the airstrikes have killed and injured hundreds of Iranian civilians, which he called a war crime and a crime against humanity. </p><p>He blasted the U.N. and the Security Council, its most powerful body, for not heeding Tehran’s warnings about the “warmongering statements” by the U.S. in recent weeks and urged the council to act now.</p><p>“The issue before the council is straightforward: whether any member state may, including a permanent member of this council, through the use of force, coercion or aggression, determine the political future or system of another state or impose control over its affairs,” Iravani said.</p><p>During his speech, the Iranian diplomat did not mention or comment on President Donald Trump’s statement that Supreme Leader Ayatollah  was killed in the strikes, although Iranian state media later confirmed his death. The assassination of the second leader of the Islamic Republic, who had no designated successor, raised the prospects of a protracted conflict given Iranian threats of retaliation. </p><h2>Iranian and US ambassadors have tense back-and-forth</h2><p>In a rare exchange, the U.S. and Iranian ambassadors traded warnings and direct rebuffs toward the end of the emergency session as military aggression between their countries risked spilling into a regional war.</p><p>After Waltz responded to Iranian claims that the U.S. had violated international law, Iravani asked to speak again to issue a warning: “I advise to the representative of the United States to be polite. It will be better for yourself and the country you represent.”</p><p>Waltz responded immediately, saying, “This representative sits here, in this body, representing a regime that has killed tens of thousands of its own people, and imprisoned many more, simply for wanting freedom from your entire tyranny.”</p><h2>Other Security Council members speak up</h2><p>Russia’s ambassador condemned the U.S.-Israeli airstrikes, while China’s ambassador was more measured in his criticism. </p><p>“We demand that the United States and Israel immediately cease their aggressive actions,” Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said. “We insist on the immediate resumption of political and diplomatic settlement efforts … based on international law, mutual respect and a balance of interests.”</p><p>China’s U.N. Ambassador Fu Cong said China was very concerned by “the sudden escalation of regional tensions” and supported Russia’s call for a return to diplomatic negotiations. </p><p>The permanent observer of the 22-nation Arab League, Maged Abdelaziz, suggested Israel was being hypocritical in justifying its military attack by saying it was intended to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Abdelaziz, a former Egyptian ambassador to the U.N., noted that Israel has refused to subject its own nuclear facilities to inspection by the U.N. nuclear watchdog. </p><p>The emergency meeting was called by five council members: Bahrain, which is the Arab representative on the council, France, Russia, China and Colombia,.</p><p>In a joint statement, the leaders of Britain and France — both veto-wielding members of the council — along with Germany’s chancellor called for a resumption of U.S.-Iranian talks on Tehran’s nuclear program. The three countries, part of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, have led efforts to reach a negotiated solution. Trump pulled the U.S. out of the deal in 2018.</p><p>The three European leaders strongly condemned Iranian airstrikes in the region — not the U.S.-Israeli airstrikes — and urged Iran’s leaders to seek a negotiated solution, saying: “Ultimately, the Iranian people must be allowed to determine their future.”</p><p>The Security Council meeting is taking place on the last day of the United Kingdom’s presidency and a day before the United States takes over the rotating presidency for the month of March.</p><p>Amiri reported from Atlanta.</p>","contentLength":5368,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1rhn05f/us_and_israel_clash_with_iran_at_emergency/"},{"title":"IRGC says 'most intense' operation against Israel and US will begin soon","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjkknqbf11l","date":1772336087,"author":"/u/Mongoose-Additional","guid":335,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1rhmr0j/irgc_says_most_intense_operation_against_israel/"},{"title":"Washington's strategy – wreaking havoc or trying to bring about regime change? | DW News","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hemJu9o5RbY","date":1772330230,"author":"DW News","guid":565,"unread":true,"content":"<article>The joint military attacks by the United States and Israel come just hours after failed nuclear negotiations between Tehran and Washington wrapped up without any breakthrough in Geneva.

Maj. Gen. Mohammad Pakpour took over as the Guard’s top commander after Israel killed its past commander in the 12-day war last June. The adviser, Ali Shamkhani, had long been a figurehead within Iran’s security establishment, IRNA said.</p><p>As reports trickled out about Khamenei’s death, eyewitnesses in Tehran told The Associated Press that some residents were rejoicing, cheering from rooftops, blowing whistles and letting out ululations.</p><p>Mourners raised a black mourning flag over the Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad, Iran’s second-largest city and a major pilgrimage site for Shiite Muslims. The Iranian government declared 40 days of public mourning and a seven-day nationwide public holiday to commemorate Khamenei’s death.</p><p>Citing unidentified sources, the semiofficial Fars news agency, believed to be close to the Revolutionary Guard, reported that several relatives of Khamenei were also killed, including a daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law and grandchild.</p><h2>Strikes were planned for months</h2><p>The joint U.S.-Israel operation, which officials say was planned for months, took place Saturday during the Muslim holy fasting  and at the start of the Iranian workweek. It followed stilted negotiations and warnings from Trump, who last year trumpeted his administration’s success in incapacitating the country’s nuclear program but nonetheless cast the latest round as necessary to head off its potential resurgence.</p><p>About 12 hours after the attacks began, the U.S. military reported no U.S. casualties and minimal damage at U.S. bases despite “hundreds of Iranian missile and drone attacks.” It said targets in Iran included Revolutionary Guard command facilities, air defense systems, missile and drone launch sites, and military airfields.</p><p>Israel, for its part, said it had killed the commander of the Revolutionary Guard Corps and the country’s defense minister, as well as the secretary of the Iranian Security Council, a close adviser to Khamenei.</p><p>Khamenei “was unable to avoid our Intelligence and Highly Sophisticated Tracking Systems and, working closely with Israel, there was not a thing he, or the other leaders that have been killed along with him, could do,” Trump said. “This is the single greatest chance for the Iranian people to take back their Country.”</p><p>An Iranian diplomat  that hundreds of civilians were killed and wounded in the strikes.

The official said intelligence showed that Iran had developed the capability to produce its own high-quality centrifuges, an important step in developing the highly enriched uranium needed for weapons.</p><p>Iran responded to the latest strikes by launching missiles and drones  and targeting U.S. military installations in Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar. The Israeli military said Iran fired dozens of missiles at Israel, with many intercepted. The Magen David Adom rescue service said Saturday night that a woman in the Tel Aviv area died after being wounded in an Iranian missile attack.</p><p>At least three explosions were heard Saturday evening near the Intelligence Ministry building in northern Tehran, witnesses said, adding that air defense systems had begun operating there. Israel’s military said it had begun new strikes against missile launchers and aerial defense systems in central Iran.</p><p>In southern Iran, at least 115 people were reported killed when a girls’ school was struck, and dozens more were wounded, the local governor told Iranian state TV. U.S. Central Command spokesperson Capt. Tim Hawkins said he was “aware of reports” that a girls’ school was struck and that officials were looking into them.</p><p>Iran’s state news agency IRNA said at least 15 people were killed in the southwest, quoting the governor of the Lamerd region, Ali Alizadeh, as saying a sports hall, two residential areas and a hall near a school were hit.</p><p>Flights across the Middle East were , and air defense fire thudded over Dubai, the United Arab Emirates’ commercial capital. Shrapnel from an Iranian missile attack on the UAE capital killed one person, state media said. </p><h2>Attack was coordinated between Israel and US</h2><p>Israel said the operation had been planned for months with the United States. Air Force pilots struck “hundreds of targets across Iran,” Israeli military chief of staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir said in a statement.</p><p>Targets in the Israeli campaign included Iran’s military, symbols of government and intelligence targets, according to an official briefed on the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss nonpublic information on the attack.</p><p>Trump acknowledged Saturday that there could be American casualties, saying “that often happens in war.” He said he was aiming to “annihilate” the Iranian navy and destroy regional proxies supported by Tehran. He called on the paramilitary  to lay down arms, saying members would be given immunity or face “certain death” if they did not.</p><p>Iran had said it hoped to avert a war, but it maintained its right to enrich uranium. </p><p>Trump had threatened military action but held off following Iran’s recent crackdown on protests spurred by economic grievances that evolved into a nationwide push against the ruling clerics.</p><p>The Human Rights Activists News Agency says it confirmed  in the crackdown and is investigating thousands more. The government has acknowledged more than 3,000 killed.</p><h2>Effects could extend to markets and other countries </h2><p>The strikes could rattle global markets, particularly if Iran makes the Strait of Hormuz unsafe for commercial traffic. A third of worldwide  transported by sea passed through the strait in 2025.</p><p>Saudi Arabia said Iran targeted its capital and eastern region in an attack that was repelled. Bahrain said a missile attack targeted the U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet headquarters in the island kingdom, and three buildings were damaged in the capital, Manama, and Muharraq city by drone strikes and debris from an intercepted missile.</p><p>Kuwait’s civil aviation authority said a drone targeted the main international airport, injuring several employees. Kuwait’s state-run news agency said three troops were injured by shrapnel from strikes that hit Ali Al-Salem air base. Explosions could also be heard in Qatar.

If convicted he faces a prison term of at least six months and up to €50,000 (£44,000) in fines. A court hearing has been scheduled for December.</p><p>On Friday, Varoufakis described the indictment as indicative of the far-right turn in politics across the west.</p><p>“My ridiculous prosecution must be seen within the wider, west-wide surge of an insidious new form of fascism,” he wrote on X, highlighting what he claimed was the appointment of “neo-fascists” to top posts in the centre-right Greek government.</p><p>“In this context, I am honoured by their determination to persecute me – as it grants me the privilege of calling upon people of good conscience, from around the world, to stand together, to oppose them.”</p><p>He accused Greece’s prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis of “cutting a deal” with the far right to ensure that, unlike elsewhere in Europe, extremists did not form their own party. In prominent ministerial positions, he said, they were then able to “use their authority to appeal to their electoral base by ensuring … that people like myself are harassed and dragged through the courts”.</p><p>Varoufakis, an economics professor widely seen on the European left as Greece’s most vociferous public intellectual, spoke candidly about his own brush with drugs on the podcast in January. Although his small leftwing party, MeRA25, narrowly failed to cross the threshold into parliament in elections in June 2023, he holds particular appeal among young voters disillusioned with mainstream politics.</p><p>Asked if he had ever used drugs, he recalled an incident in Sydney in 1989 when, after a Mardi Gras parade, he had taken ecstasy during a Kylie Minogue concert. “I’m not like Bill Clinton who ‘did not inhale’. I inhaled,” he said. “I took ecstasy once. It was an amazing experience until a few days later when I had an incredible migraine … I remember dancing 15 to 16 hours, as if nothing had happened, but then I suffered for a week and never took it again.”</p><p>He went on to admit that he was still partial to “grass, but I can’t find it, and no one will give it to me”.</p><p>Critics, including TV show hosts, lashed out at the politician, accusing him of abusing his status as a role model. However, he is not the first public figure in Greece to have spoken out about recreational drug use.</p><p>The former mayor of Athens, Kostas Bakoyannis, who is Mitsotakis’s nephew, confessed in a TV interview in 2017 to smoking hashish, adding, with a laugh, that he had felt the urge to do it at family gatherings. Artists and scientists have also spoken publicly about drug use. None, however, have been prosecuted as a result.</p><p>As the row has deepened, so has support for Varoufakis.</p><p>Charalampos Poulopoulos, widely considered Greece’s pre-eminent drug abuse expert, told the Guardian the remarks were not only an expression of opinion and, as such, “a constitutionally guaranteed right”, but fell far short of promoting illegal substances and inciting others to take them.</p><p>“Several times in the past, public figures have talked about their experience with substance use in their youth without it being considered a criminal offence,” said Poulopoulos, now professor of social work in addictions at the University of West Attica. “His comments are clearly being exploited today to cultivate political fear on the basis of a fabricated risk around the spread of drugs. If convicted, he’ll become a hero. This very surprising prosecution neither serves the common good, nor public interest.”</p><p>Until laws were amended more than a decade ago, Greece had some of the toughest anti-drug legislation in Europe. In a society both socially conservative and often late to trends, heavy drug use <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/16/greek-addicts-sisha-drug-crisis\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">arrived</a> with the debt-stricken country’s economic crisis in 2010 when unemployment and poverty began to soar.</p><p>Varoufakis took over as finance minister in 2015 as Greece’s struggle to keep bankruptcy at bay intensified shortly after a radical leftwing government assumed power.</p><p>In a statement MeRA25 vowed to tackle the issue of addiction with “a modern scientific approach and not with gendarmerie-style attitudes from the 1950s”.</p><p>Varoufakis has, meanwhile, pledged to continue speaking the language of truth in a society he claims is awash with “hypocrisy and cocaine”.</p>","contentLength":4728,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1rhhpw2/yanis_varoufakis_calls_prosecution_after/"},{"title":"Australia 'did not participate' in Operation Epic Fury in Iran","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2026-03-01/australia-not-involved-iran-operation-epic-fury/106401742","date":1772320841,"author":"/u/Expensive-Horse5538","guid":330,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Foreign Minister Penny Wong has confirmed Australia was not involved in the major Israeli-United States operation in Iran that has decapitated its leadership.</p><p>Senator Wong also confirmed Australia was not told in advance of Operation Epic Fury.</p><p>\"Obviously, we did not participate in the strikes and you would not expect us to participate,\" she said.</p><p>The minister refused to comment on whether Australian intelligence contributed to the operation \"as a general proposition\".</p><p>\"These are strikes which are determined by the parties concerned, which is the United States and Israel,\" she said.</p><p>Senator Wong urged the resumption of dialogue and diplomacy, which had been underway until the surprise attack.</p><p>Following a meeting of the National Security Committee of Cabinet this morning, the government is urgently seeking to confirm whether any Australians have been affected.</p><p>Official travel advice has been upgraded with Australians warned not to travel to Israel, Lebanon, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the foreign department was registering names of people seeking to depart Israel and Iran, though he noted that capacity to help people inside Iran was restricted.</p><p>Mr Albanese expressed his hope for the people of Iran, and concerns over regional escalation.</p><p>\"When Iranians went out on the street to demand their human rights … we saw the [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps] crack down brutally, thousands murdered,\" he said.</p><p>\"This is a regime that — we hope that the Iranian people are able to determine their own destiny.\"</p><figure data-print=\"inline-media\" data-component=\"Figure\" data-uri=\"coremedia://imageproxy/106402204\"><div><figcaption data-component=\"Figure__figcaption\"><p data-component=\"Typography\">Prime Minister Anthony Albanese expressed his hopes for the people of Iran after a major operation against the Iranian regime.</p></figcaption></div></figure><p>The prime minister urged a swift resolution to the attack.</p><h2 data-component=\"Heading\">Khamenei's death 'won't be mourned'</h2><p>Iranian state media has confirmed that its Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was killed in the attack, with Israel also claiming the deaths of other Iranian defence leaders.</p><p>Mr Albanese said the Ayatollah would not be mourned.</p><p>\"He is responsible for orchestrating attacks on Australian soil.

Iran-backed Hezbollah terror group called on Saturday for the Middle East to stand against Israel and the US after they launched a joint military offensive against Iran, after long weeks of escalating regional tensions and burgeoning threats of conflict.</p><p>Hezbollah condemned the “American-Israeli hostilities against the Islamic Republic,” but stopped short of pledging to retaliate against Israel, amid fears that it could become involved in the conflict.</p><p>The Lebanese terrorist organization also did not intervene in the 12-day war between Israel and Iran last June, which the US briefly joined.</p><p>“We call on countries and people of the region to stand strong in the face of these hostile designs,” Hezbollah said in a statement, warning that “its dire consequences will affect everyone without exception if left unchecked.”</p><p>“We’re certain that the American-Israeli enemy will be dealt a major blow, and reap nothing but failure from its criminal, tyrannical aggression,” Hezbollah added.</p><p>Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem was scheduled to make a televised speech later Saturday, but it was subsequently postponed.</p><p>The statement came after a Hezbollah official had told AFP this week that it would not intervene militarily in the event of “limited” US strikes, but would consider any attack against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei a “red line.” Khamenei was among the senior Iranian officials targeted in the initial strikes.</p><p>Before the operation against Iran began, Israel launched a wave of airstrikes on Hezbollah targets — including tunnel shafts and rocket launching sites — across southern Lebanon on Saturday morning.</p><p>According to the Israel Defense Forces, Hezbollah was recently working to restore its military capabilities at the targeted sites in order to advance attacks on Israel.</p><p>“This activity constitutes a violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon and a threat to the State of Israel,” the IDF said.</p><p>Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency reported that the Israeli strikes targeted mountainous areas in the south where Hezbollah has a strong presence.</p><p>Earlier Saturday, Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam earlier in the day saying that Lebanon refused to be dragged into war.</p><p>“I reiterate that we will not accept anyone dragging the country into adventures that threaten its security and unity,” Salam said on X.</p><p>“In light of the serious developments unfolding in the region, I once again call on all Lebanese to act with wisdom and patriotism, placing Lebanon and the Lebanese people’s interests above any other consideration,” he added.</p><p>Salam later said his government was making diplomatic contacts to avoid any “repercussions” of the conflict.</p><p>At the same time, US Ambassador to Lebanon Michel Issa told Lebanese President Joseph Aoun that Israel will not escalate against Lebanon if it refrains from hostile actions.</p><p>Aoun stressed that “sparing Lebanon the disasters and horrors of external conflicts, and preserving its sovereignty, security and stability, are an absolute priority.”</p><p>Many airlines, meanwhile, announced the cancellation of their flights to airports in the Middle East, including Beirut.</p><p>Salam, however, said Beirut’s “airport remains open” and that “the national carrier’s flights are continuing.”</p><p>In a post on X, United Nations special coordinator for Lebanon Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert urged “all parties in Lebanon” to “prioritize, in words and actions, the need to shield the country and its people from unfolding regional developments.”</p>","contentLength":3570,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1rhedzn/hezbollah_condemns_strikes_on_iran_but_stops/"},{"title":"Is
