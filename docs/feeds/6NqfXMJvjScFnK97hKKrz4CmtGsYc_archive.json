It helps troops prepare for combat and train in realistic scenarios.</p><p> that shows the position of USS Iwo Jima, the ship where these live-shooting drills were happening. The imagery shows the ship less than 200km away from the coastline of Venezuela.</p><p>USS Iwo Jima is anamphibious assault ship that serves as a core component of US expeditionary forces, capable of launching amphibious invasions.</p><p>USS Iwo Jima was also seen accompanied by two other USS destroyers, within around 20km of each other.</p><p>The ship's arrival follows the announcement that the USS Gerald R Ford Aircraft carrier is also being moved towards the Caribbean Sea, with three US destroyers alongside it.</p><p>Sean Parnell, assistant to the Secretary of War for Public Affairs, said in a statement on X on 24 October that the forces will \"enhance and augment existing capabilities to disrupt narcotics trafficking and degrade and dismantle\" transnational criminal organisations.</p><p>He was thought to be describing fishing boats which they suspected of trafficking drugs, but so far there is no evidence to confirm this.</p><p>The deployment means there will be 14% of the US Navy's fleet in the Caribbean, showing a significant build-up of force.</p><p>USS Gerald R Ford was spotted just off the coast of Italy on its way to the Caribbean on 29 October.</p><p>Mr Cancian, senior advisor of defence and security at the Centre for Strategic International Studies (CSIS), told Sky News: \"The United States only has 11 carriers, three are at sea at any one time. So, moving one of them into the Caribbean is very significant, it does a couple of things. It puts more pressure on the Maduro regime, and it brings a lot of combat power into the Caribbean.\"</p><p>He described the USS Gerald R Ford as a \"use it or lose it\" asset, saying \"it's so powerful and so scarce, carrier strike groups, that other regional commanders will want to use the battle group\".</p><p>He added, when the airstrike carrier arrives in the Caribbean, a decision will have to be made.</p><p>\"If the administration wants to conduct strikes, the arrival of the Ford would open that window for those attacks,\" he said.</p><p>On 30 October, the Wall Street Journal reported that US officials said the Trump administration has identified targets in Venezuela that include military facilities used to smuggle drugs.</p><p><strong>Is the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier the best military asset for targeting drug boats?</strong></p><p>Nick Brown, director at Janes defence intelligence company, told Sky News the \"Gerald R Ford is the US Navy's newest aircraft carrier and the largest warship currently in US service\".</p><p>He said there are 4,805 crew members on board and a full range of precision air-to-surface bombs, missiles and rockets, \"able to tackle a wide variety of tactical and strategic targets\".</p><p>The aircraft carrier also carries an abundance of fighter jets, typically 24 F/A-18s and 24 F-35s.</p><p>Mr Cancian said: \"It's not a very good asset for countering drug traffic. The strike aircraft are very powerful, but they move too fast to identify small boats. There are some helicopters that could help, but what the carrier is very good at is attacks against adversary military forces or targets ashore.</p><p>\"The strike aircraft operate at 500, 600mph. So, they're going very fast. And to spot a small boat and then to identify it, very difficult.\"</p><p><strong>Increasing pressure in the skies</strong></p><p>As well as the sea, the US appears to have been more active in the air over the Caribbean Sea. Flight tracking data shows the US have flown bombers off the Venezuelan coast, B1s and B52s.</p><p>The B1-B bomber is primarily a fast, heavy-hitting conventional \"bomb truck\" designed rapidly to deliver massive amounts of precision weapons, while the B-52 bomber is a versatile, long-range \"missile truck\".</p><p>Flight tracking data from 27 October shows two B1-B bomber jets flying over the Caribbean Sea.</p><p>\"The administration has flown bombers off the Venezuelan coast, B1s and B52s. So, they have been steadily increasing the pressure,\" Mr Cancian said.</p><a href=\"https://news.sky.com/download-app\" target=\"blank\" data-tracking-label=\"ui-app-promo-download-link\" data-type=\"\" data-component-name=\"ui-app-promo\" data-testid=\"app-promo\"></a><p>Three B-52 bombers were also seen on flight tracking on 30 October, leaving from Jacksonville (Florida) and Shreveport (Louisiana). They circled their surrounding areas for two hours before returning to their base.</p><p>The satellite imagery below shows six F35-B fighter jets, capable of performing air-to-surface, electronic warfare, intelligence gathering, and air-to-air missions simultaneously at Puerto Rico on 17 October.</p><p><strong>Uptick of strikes in the Pacific </strong></p><p>US Southern Command have been criticised for choosing targets in the Caribbean Sea rather than the Eastern Pacific.</p><p>Mr Cancian explained that \"much of the drug traffic that comes to the United States allegedly comes along the Pacific route... so not focusing on that flow\" was considered curious.</p><p>On 28 October, the US Southern Command defended their operational targets in a post on X saying: \"The Department has spent over TWO DECADES defending other homelands. Now, we're defending our own. These narco-terrorists have killed more Americans than Al-Qaeda, and they will be treated the same. We will track them, we will network them, and then, we will hunt and kill them.\"</p><p><em>The Data X Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

It just isn’t admitting as much","url":"https://theconversation.com/europe-is-allowing-itself-to-be-dominated-by-the-us-it-just-isnt-admitting-as-much-267060","date":1761961871,"author":"/u/Crossstoney","guid":607,"unread":true,"content":"<p>For 80&nbsp;years, Europe maintained an asymmetric yet cooperative relationship with the United States. This imbalance, long accepted as the price of stability and protection, has shifted dramatically under US President Donald Trump. What was once a strategically uneven interdependence has become an unbreakable grip, which is used to exert pressure while being denied by its victims.</p><p>In my book, <a href=\"https://editionsdelaube.fr/catalogue_de_livres/latlantisme-est-mort-vive-leurope/\"><em>l’Atlantisme est mort&nbsp;? Vive l’Europe&nbsp;!</em></a> (Is Atlanticism Dead? Long Live Europe!), I describe this shift by introducing the concept of : a permitted grip in which Europeans, believing themselves to be partners, become dependent on a power that dominates them without their full awareness.</p><p> does not merely refer to influence or soft power, but an internalised strategic subordination. Europeans justify this dependence in the name of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/european-gloom-over-the-trump-deal-is-misplaced-its-probably-the-best-the-eu-could-have-achieved-262369\">realism</a>, <a href=\"https://chairestrategique.pantheonsorbonne.fr/themes/2019/why-america-us-role-european-defense-and-european-mind\">security</a>, or economic stability, without recognising that it structurally weakens them.</p><p>In Trump’s worldview, Europeans are no longer allies but freeloaders. The common market enabled them to become the world’s largest consumer zone and strengthen their companies’ competitiveness, including in the US market. Meanwhile, through NATO, they let Washington bear the costs of collective defence.</p><p>The result? According to Trump, the US – because it is strong, generous, and noble – is being “taken advantage of” by its allies. This narrative justifies a shift: allies become resources to exploit. It is no longer cooperation, but extraction.</p><h2>Ukraine as a pressure lever</h2><p>The war in Ukraine perfectly illustrates this logic. While the EU mobilized to support Kyiv, this solidarity became a vulnerability exploited by Washington. When the Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2025/us-resumes-military-aid-and-intelligence-sharing-as-ukraine-says-it-is-open-to-a-30-day-ceasefire/\">temporarily suspended Ukrainian access to US intelligence</a>, the Ukrainian army became blind. Europeans, also dependent on this data, were left half-blind.</p><p>The administration’s move was not a mere tactical adjustment, but a strategic signal: European autonomy is conditional.</p><p>In July&nbsp;2025, the EU accepted a deeply unbalanced <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_25_1930\">trade agreement</a> imposing 15% tariffs on its products, without reciprocity. The Turnberry agreement was negotiated at Trump’s private estate in Scotland – a strong symbol of the personalization and brutalization of international relations.</p><p>At the same time, the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/02/us-halts-ukraine-weapons-shipments\">stopped delivering weapons directly</a> to Ukraine. Europeans now buy American-made arms and deliver them themselves to Kyiv. This is no longer partnership, but forced delegation.</p><h2>From partners to tributaries</h2><p>In the logic of the MAGA movement, which is dominant within the Republican Party, Europe is no longer a partner. At best, it is a client; at worst, a tributary.</p><p>In this situation, Europeans accept their subordination without naming it. This consent rests on two illusions: the idea that this dependence is the least bad option, and the belief that it is temporary.</p><p>Yet many European actors – political leaders, entrepreneurs, and industrialists – supported the Turnberry agreement and the intensification of US arms purchases. In 2025, Europe accepted a perverse deal: paying for its political, commercial and budgetary alignment in exchange for uncertain protection.</p><p>It is a quasi-mafia logic of international relations, based on intimidation, brutalization and the subordination of “partners”. Like Don Corleone in Frances Ford Coppola’s The Godfather, Trump seeks to impose an unpredictable American protection in exchange for an arbitrary price set unilaterally by the US.</p><h2> and imperialism: two logics of domination</h2><p>It is essential to distinguish  from other forms of domination. Unlike President Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whose imperialism relies on military violence, Trump’s US does not use direct force. When Trump threatens to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/trumps-greenland-bid-is-really-about-control-of-the-arctic-and-the-coming-battle-with-china-246900\">annex Greenland</a>, he exerts pressure but does not mobilize troops. He acts through economic coercion, trade blackmail, and political pressure.</p><p>Because Europeans are partially aware of this and debate the acceptable degree of pressure, this grip is all the more insidious. It is systemic, normalized, and thus hard to contest.</p><p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/ukraine-war-people-are-fighting-and-dying-for-vladimir-putins-flawed-version-of-history-178925\">Putin</a>’s regime, by contrast, relies on violence as a principle of government – against its own society and its neighbours. The invasion of Ukraine is its culmination. Both systems exercise domination, but through different logics: Russian imperialism is brutal and direct; US  is accepted, constraining, and denied.</p><p>What makes  particularly dangerous is the denial that accompanies it. Europeans continue to speak of <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2025/02/03/remarks-by-president-antonio-costa-at-the-press-conference-following-the-informal-eu-leaders-retreat-of-3-february-2025/\">the transatlantic partnership</a>, <a href=\"https://www.eeas.europa.eu/united-states-america/european-union-and-united-states_en\">shared values</a>, and strategic alignment. But the reality is one of accepted coercion.</p><p>This denial is not only rhetorical: it shapes policies. European leaders justify trade concessions, arms purchases, and diplomatic alignments as reasonable compromises. They hope Trump will pass, that the old balance will return.</p><p>But  is not a minor development. It is a structural transformation of the transatlantic relationship. And as long as Europe does not name it, it will keep weakening – strategically, economically and politically.</p><h2>Naming  to resist it</h2><p>Europe must open its eyes. The transatlantic link, once protective, has become an instrument of domination. The concept of  allows us to name this reality – and naming is already resisting.</p><p>The question is now clear: does Europe want to remain a passive subject of US strategy, or become a strategic actor again? The answer will determine its place in tomorrow’s world.</p><p><em>A weekly e-mail in English featuring expertise from scholars and researchers.
