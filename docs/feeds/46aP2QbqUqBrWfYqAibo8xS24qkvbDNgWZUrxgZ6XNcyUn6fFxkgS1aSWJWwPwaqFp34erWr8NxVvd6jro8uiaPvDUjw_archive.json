I also just searched through Github and Gitlab &amp; can&#39;t really find any simple front-end example applications I can deploy.

My goal is to stand up a high availability k3s cluster for serving stuff in my house like PiHole, my reverse proxy service, and authentik. Then to see how well I can deploy my other services that have more specific hardware requirements.</p> <p>I have one or two &quot;servers&quot; in my house but much of my compute is on raspberry and orange pi because they&#39;re so cheap. If I have one or two big-iron servers and ten pis, what is the best architecture/structure for a k3s cluster?</p> <p>Should I just select three pis to be master nodes and everything else agents? I think I want the big-iron servers to be a agent nodes, right? Because they&#39;re the ones I want actually &quot;doing the work&quot;.</p> <p>Bonus question: Why do the instructions say HA is 3 or more master nodes and &quot;zero or more agents&quot;. If I understand the structure correctly, masters just organize the work for the agents and the agents handle the workload. I don&#39;t see why anyone would stand up a k3s cluster with zero agent nodes.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/spikeygg\"> /u/spikeygg </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1hm20q1/structurearchitecture_questions/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1hm20q1/structurearchitecture_questions/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Convert nginx reverse proxy to kubernetes configuration","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1hm1mmu/convert_nginx_reverse_proxy_to_kubernetes/","date":1735136764,"author":"/u/Connect_Computer_528","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Previously I used docker-compose with Frontend and API, and NGINX image as a reverse proxy.
