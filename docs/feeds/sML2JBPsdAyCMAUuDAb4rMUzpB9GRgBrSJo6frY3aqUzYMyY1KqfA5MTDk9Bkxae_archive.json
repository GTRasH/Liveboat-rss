This is the life we chose, and if we’re writing Rust programs to\ntalk to remote APIs such as Weatherstack, as we did in <a href=\"https://bitfieldconsulting.com/posts/here-comes-sun\">Here comes the sun</a>, we’ll have to be\nable to cope with them sending us JSON data.</p><p>We’ll also need a way to turn that JSON into good honest Rust data,\nso we can compute stuff about it. Let’s see how to do that, as we\ncontinue to hack on our embarrassingly basic weather client program.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://bitfieldconsulting.com/posts/elephants-for-breakfast\">Elephants for\nbreakfast</a> we pondered how to test a function such as\n when we can’t know in advance \nweather conditions it’ll return. The correct response is literally up in\nthe air.</p><p>So we deftly flipped the problem——and decided\ninstead to write two functions that  testable:\n, which constructs the HTTP request to be sent to\nWeatherstack, and , which unpacks the\nanswer.</p><p>We’ve already written , or rather you did—great\njob on that, by the way! Let’s turn to  now.\nHere’s how we plan to call it as part of the \nfunction:</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>At this point we’ve already made the API request, and now\n contains the response, consisting of weather data in a\nspecific JSON format.</p><p>We’re saying here that if we pass the body of that response as a\n to , we should get back a\n struct representing the weather conditions that\nwere encoded in the JSON.</p><p>That sounds like something we can test, so it’s over to you again to\nfigure out how.</p><p> Write a test for \nalong these lines.</p><p> We have the real JSON data we saved earlier\nwhen making our <a href=\"https://bitfieldconsulting.com/posts/here-comes-sun\">exploratory request</a>\nto Weatherstack (if not, make it again). That’ll be perfect test data\nfor : we already know exactly what weather\nconditions it encodes, so all we need to do is check the result against\nthe corresponding  struct.</p><p> Here’s my attempt:</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>There’s no need to test extracting any of the other stuff in the\nJSON; we don’t use it, so extracting it would be a waste of time, and\ntesting that extraction even more so.</p><p>That was easy, I think you’ll agree, so let’s turn to the actual\nextraction. How are we going to turn a  into a\n?</p><p>You know if you’ve read my moderately bestselling book <a href=\"https://bitfieldconsulting.com/books/rust-tools\">The Secrets of Rust: Tools</a> that we can use\nthe  library to serialize and deserialize Rust structs\nto JSON by using the  attribute. For example:</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>By deriving the  trait, we asked\n to autogenerate code for turning a \nstruct into, effectively, a , and\n, naturally enough, does the reverse.</p><p>So could we do the same kind of thing here? Could we define some Rust\nstruct that mirrors the schema of the JSON data returned by\nWeatherstack, and derive  on it?</p><p>Yes, we could do it that way, but it turns out to be rather\nlaborious, because the API’s schema consists of \nstructures. We’d have to define structs for each level of the JSON we’re\ninterested in. For example, at the top level, we only want\n:</p><p>So we have to start by defining a struct that represents the entire\nresponse, with a single field for  (we can ignore\nall the others):</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>And, of course, we now need another struct definition to represent\nwhat’s inside :</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>It’s already getting annoying, and you can imagine there would be\nmany more of these structs if we had to deal with further levels of\nnesting in the API data. The worst part is that we don’t even\n these structs! There’s no function in our program that\nneeds to take or return a , for example: we\nalready have our own struct  that contains exactly\nand only the data we want.</p><p>Surely this isn’t the right way to use Rust’s type system. What we’d\nprefer is a way to look up the data we want directly in the JSON, and\nthen transfer it to our  struct, without going via a\nbunch of useless paperwork.</p><p>Luckily,  provides a way to do this, using a\nsyntax called “JSON Pointer”. First, we deserialize the data to the\nall-purpose type :</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>Assuming that we successfully get , then its contents\nrepresent the whole JSON object contained in the response. We can reach\nin and grab some specific part of it using a path-like notation:</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>Much more direct than using a bunch of intermediate structs. Of\ncourse, there might not  a value at that path, so it makes\nsense that  returns an , doesn’t\nit? (Read more about this in my tutorial on <a href=\"https://bitfieldconsulting.com/posts/rust-errors-option-result\">Results and Options in\nRust</a>.)</p><p>If this path didn’t exist in the JSON, the result would be\n, straightforwardly. But we can be pretty confident\nthat the server’s response  include this data, so the\nresult will be , and it will contain another\n representing whatever was found at the given\npath.</p><p>So let’s try to write  now using this\n“pointer” approach:</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>We’ve added a little extra paperwork here in case the lookups fail,\nusing  to return a suitable error message along\nwith the problematic JSON data.</p><p>Assuming the lookups succeed, though, we need to turn the resulting\ns into real Rust types:</p><p> is a useful little tool whenever we’re dealing\nwith s like this. If the option is ,\nit just does nothing. But if it’s , then it extracts\nthe value and applies the given function to it. In this case, that’s\n for the temperature, which parses the value as a\nfloating-point number, and  for the summary.</p><p>Having extracted, checked, and converted our \nand  values, then, we write them into our\n struct using the field init shorthand, and return\nit.</p><h3>Taking it for a trial run</h3><p>This passes the test, which is encouraging, so we now have the two <a href=\"https://bitfieldconsulting.com/posts/magic-function\">magic functions</a> we need to write\n.</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>I mean, if you cross off the parts we’ve already tested\n( and ), there’s not much\nleft, is there? The only substantive thing we don’t test is\n, and that’s not our code—we can assume\n itself works, or someone would have noticed by\nnow.</p><p>Let’s run the updated program for real and see what happens.</p><pre><code>Error: bad response: {\"error\":{\"code\":601,\"info\":\"Please specify a\nvalid location identifier using the query parameter.\",\"type\":\n\"missing_query\"},\"success\":false}</code></pre><p>Oops. That’s on me; I didn’t give a location on the command line to\nquery the weather for. But that’s exactly the sort of mistake that any\nuser might make, so we’d better catch it and provide a slightly nicer\nerror message:</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>Let’s try again, this time with a location:</p><pre><code>Weather { temperature: 12.0, summary: \"Partly cloudy\" }</code></pre><p>Fine. All our magic is working perfectly. That’s reassuring, so let’s\ntake this opportunity to tighten up a few bolts and caulk a few seams.\nWe’ll define a real implementation of , so that the\noutput doesn’t look so nerdy:</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>Nothing new here except this format parameter for the\ntemperature:</p><p>The  means “print to one decimal place”, rounding if\nnecessary. Without this, a temperature of 12.0 would print as just “12”,\nwhich seems a shame. We worked to get that extra decimal place: let’s\nhang on to it!</p><p>Here’s what it looks like with this change:</p><h3>Mixing arguments and\nenvironment variables</h3><p>And, since we’re going to the trouble of validating our arguments,\nlet’s hand that over to  and derive a suitable\n parser:</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>You might well think that if we’re deploying the awesome power of\n now, couldn’t we also use it to take the API key as a\ncommand-line option? That would be a nice enhancement, but currently\nwe’re looking for it in an environment variable:</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>Ideally, we’d have  get this from a flag if it’s\nprovided that way, and if not, look for it in the environment variable.\nAnd it turns out we can do exactly that, if we opt in to the\n feature:</p><p><strong><code>cargo add clap -F derive,env</code></strong></p><pre><code></code></pre><p>What we’re saying is, if the user provides the \nflag, use that value, and if they don’t, fall back to looking for it in\nthe environment variable. If it’s not there either, report an error,\nbecause this is a required flag.</p><p>By the way, while it’s conventional for Rust field names to be styled\nin so-called “snake case” (), it’s \nconventional for command-line arguments to be styled in so-called “kebab\ncase” (), so  makes this\ntransformation for us automatically. That’s the wonderful thing about\nconventions, of course: there are so many of them.</p><p>Very well, then. We’ve built a decent library crate that actually\ngets weather, and it has some tests. We can be pretty confident that\nboth  and  are implemented\nproperly. Since we can’t test the way they’re glued together in\n, I guess we’ll just have to hope it’s correct,\nright?</p><p>If you don’t think “hope” is a strategy, tune in next time to see\nwhether we can’t do a little better.</p>","contentLength":8289,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The best Go training providers in 2025","url":"https://bitfieldconsulting.com/posts/best-go-training","date":1760346643,"author":"John Arundel","guid":149,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Go (also known as “Golang”) is a modern programming language that is\nrelatively easy to learn.

The names\nyou should probably consider first are Bitfield Consulting, Ferrous\nSystems, and Ardan Labs. Here’s our take on how to choose:</p><h3>Most cost-effective:\nBitfield Consulting</h3><p>For those on a budget or wanting the most flexibility,\n’s Rust training is the most\ncost-effective: it can cover as much or as little ground as your team\nneeds. It focuses on deep understanding of the language, design skills\nfor complex projects, and software engineering mastery. Instructor John\nArundel is known as someone who can explain complex topics simply, in a\nfun and engaging way; attendees describe him as an “amazing mentor”.</p><h3>Best for embedded Rust:\nFerrous Systems</h3><p>If your business targets embedded devices, , with their expertise in this area, is a good choice.\nThey’re a recognised brand in the Rust community, sponsoring many\nconferences and meetups, and an excellent fit for companies in the\nautomotive, medical, or industrial fields, through their association\nwith the Ferrocene toolchain. Prices are relatively high compared to\nBitfield Consulting, but the extra name recognition could be worth\npaying for.</p><h3>Best for C++ developers: Ardan\nLabs</h3><p> have a well-established reputation in\nother language communities; in particular, founder Bill Kennedy is a\nrecognised Go expert and popular conference speaker. As a company, they\nalso contribute to open source and charitable efforts such as Women Who\nGo. While their side venture into Rust is relatively new, customers can\nexpect solid, well-delivered training that, while more expensive than\nsome competitors, is a good fit for very experienced programmers\nmigrating from other languages such as C++.</p>","contentLength":7106,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":["dev"]}
