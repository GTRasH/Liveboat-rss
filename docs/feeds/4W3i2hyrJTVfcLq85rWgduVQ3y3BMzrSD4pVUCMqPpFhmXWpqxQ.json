This is because every part needs to be dynamic and optimized for speed.<p>So a few years ago I've started to work on a web browser that intentionally doesn't implement JavaScript, instead it contains an updated set of scripts that fix and improve various websites.<p>I've been using this approach using a proxy server for a few years as my primary way of web browsing with good results. It uses a whitelist approach where no resources are loaded from different domains by default (the fix scripts can override it to load images from CDNs, etc.). This avoids any trackers by default.<p>You can find more details on the homepage of the project:<p><a href=\"https://www.fixbrowser.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.fixbrowser.org/</a><p>I'm currently running a fundraiser to get it really going. All the foundation blocks are there it just needs some more work.
