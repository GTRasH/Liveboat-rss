At its height in the 18th and 19th centuries, whaling was a global enterprise built on perilous voyages, long seasons at sea, and a fierce chase for oil and baleen that illuminated streets and homes and lubricated the industrial revolution. In doing so, obsessed nations like Britain, Norway and America hounded whale populations to the brink, decimating populations and altering marine ecosystems forever.&nbsp;</p><p>But it's important to remember that this industry also has a rich social history. Whaling sustained communities across the globe, providing work, culture and a crucial way of life for working people in coastal regions and on remote islands like Shetland off the coast of Scotland.&nbsp;</p><p>In this episode, Dan heads to Dundee, once a hub of the whaling industry, to explore both the devastating ecological impact and the rich human story to give us a fuller understanding of the history of whaling. He speaks to the curators at the South Georgia Museum, Jayne Pierce and Helen Balfour, as well as Richard Sabin from the Natural History Museum and also one of Shetland's last remaining whalers, Gibby Fraser.&nbsp;</p><p>You can explore more at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://whalersmemorybank.sgmuseum.gs/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://whalersmemorybank.sgmuseum.gs/</a>&nbsp;to read through testimonies from other whalers, see incredible archive images and learn more about whales in the Arctic and Antarctic.&nbsp;</p><p>Produced by Mariana Des Forges and edited by Dougal Patmore</p>","contentLength":1409,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/697ca97065c54ec919934339/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&sig=8V6HMTZXcJrANeg3vQ5Un-Wb20Aqv13is2tTc8k_MhE","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":["podcast"]}
