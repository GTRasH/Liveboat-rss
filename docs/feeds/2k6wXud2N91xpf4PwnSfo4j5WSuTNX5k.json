From a report: Tens of thousands of online retailers now offer the service for a few dollars per order. The fees go to young companies -- Route and Corso, to name two -- that promise to make customers whole without charging the merchant if a delivery doesn't arrive. Consumers are finding that retailers either ask them to pay for package protection or draw a harder line when it comes to replacing a missing item. Some retailers are making the fees mandatory, spreading the burden of package theft among all customers. \n\nTo know whether you are paying the fee, review your order before you press purchase. Sometimes it is named after the company offering protection, and sometimes it is called shipping insurance or package protection. Skincare brand Topicals began using Corso two years ago after seeing 30% of its packages were regularly marked delivered but not received, according to customer insights manager Deja Jefferson. By requiring protection, which Topicals discloses on its shipping page, the company doesn't have to worry about convincing customers to opt in. \"We actually don't get any complaints on it whatsoever,\" she said.

Some 38 trillion characters had been auto-translated. Seven trillion megabytes of PC memory had been saved through the use of sleeping tabs. \n\nHowever, are those numbers actually as big as they seem? What Microsoft did not say is how little Edge has moved the needle on market share in 2024. Strangely, the company did not share raw usage information. Yet, a look at Statcounter's figures for browser desktop market share showed Edge with 11.9 percent of the market in December 2023 and reaching 12.87 percent by November 2024 -- an increase of less than 1 percent. The market leader, Google's Chrome browser, went from 65.23 percent to 66.33 percent in the same period.

Recall from the previous illustration that Alice/Carol is called the holder, and Bob/Dave is the writer, and Carol or Dave is required to pay a transfer fee to the corresponding seller. The payment 𝑃 is called the premium. 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐺 deposited by Bob is called guarantee. transfer fee or any other asset escrowed in contracts are referred to as collateral.</p>\n<h3 id=\"51optiontransferproperties\">5.1 Option Transfer Properties</h3>\n<p>There are two fundamental properties that must be satisfied during the option transfer process.</p>\n<p>\\\n• <em>Safety (No Underwater</em>): A compliant party must not lose any collateral/position during the transfer process without acquiring an corresponding collateral/position. </p>\n<p>\\\n• <em>Liveness</em>: During the transfer of the holder or writer position, if all parties are conforming, the holder or writer will correctly transfer to the buyer, and the holder or writer will receive the correct transfer fee.</p>\n<p>\\\nTheorem 1. <em>Protocol 4.2.1 satisfies safety (no-underwater):</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<em>• If Alice is conforming and loses her position, then she will obtain either Carol’s collateral, Bob’s collateral and guarantee, or both.</em> </p>\n<p>\\\n<em>• If Bob is conforming and loses his position, then he will obtain Dave’s collateral.</em> </p>\n<p>\\\n<em>• If Carol is conforming and loses her collateral, then Carol will obtain the holder position of the option.</em> </p>\n<p>\\\n<em>• If Dave is conforming and loses his collateral, then Dave will obtain the writer position of the option.</em></p>\n<p>\\\nProof. See Details in Appendix Section B.1.1.</p>\n<p>\\\nTheorem 2. <em>Protocol 4.2.1 satisfies liveness: If Alice, Bob, and Carol/Dave are conforming, then Alice/Bob will obtain Carol/Dave’s collateral, Carol/Dave will obtain Alice/Bob’s position, and Bob/Alice will retain their original position.</em></p>\n<p>\\\nTheorem 1 guarantees that an honest party will not incur losses in the transfer protocol, even if another party irrationally forfeits their assets, thus protecting the interests of contract adherents. We list theorems related to other properties, with proofs in Appendix B.1. Theorem 2 ensures that if the transfer proceeds correctly, all participants receive the intended outcomes.</p>\n<p>\\\nThree properties must be ensured during the transfer process: Unobstructibility, Independence, and Isolation. First, external interferences cannot disrupt the transfer by the conforming parties. Second, after a successful transfer, the holder or writer is updated to another party, ensuring that the transfer does not affect future transactions. Finally, the transfer process for the holder and the writer must be isolated, with no mutual influence.</p>\n<p>\\\n• <strong>Unobstructibility</strong>: If both the buyer and the seller are conforming parties, no other party can obstruct the transfer process. </p>\n<p>\\\n• <strong>Independence</strong>: After a successful transfer, subsequent transfers can proceed normally, and the previous position holder cannot interfere with future transfers. </p>\n<p>\\\n• <strong>Isolation</strong>: The processes of transferring options by the holder and the writer to other buyers can occur simultaneously and separately, without interference from each other.</p>\n<p>\\\nTheorem 3. <em>Protocol 4.2.1 satisfies unobstructibility: Alice/Bob can transfer the position to another party even if Bob/Alice is adversarial.</em></p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-81034tn.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nTheorem 5. <em>Protocol 4.2.2 satisfies isolation: Alice and Bob can simultaneously and separately transfer their positions to Carol and Dave, respectively. This means that transferring holder and the transferring writer can proceed concurrently.</em></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Authors:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) Zifan Peng, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (zpengao@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn);</p>\n<p>(2) Yingjie Xue, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (yingjiexue@hkust-gz.edu.cn);</p>\n<p>(3) Jingyu Liu, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (jliu514@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn).</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<hr />\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15724\">available on arxiv</a> under CC BY 4.0 license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"A New Way to Trade Options Without Collateral","url":"https://hackernoon.com/a-new-way-to-trade-options-without-collateral?source=rss","date":1735162210,"author":"EScholar: Electronic Academic Papers for Scholars","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<h2 id=\"tableoflinks\">Table of Links</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/Um9xbWbUFDMzkXakWgDh\">Abstract and Introduction</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/preview/dKHrehhbzuaTHtgJFbvy\">Preliminaries</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/preview/oyJxVXND1XBuIkqdQbUB\">Overview</a> </p></li>\n<li><p>Protocol</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/zubShKzeJXXu82JolWP1\">4.1 Efficient Option Transfer Protocol</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/preview/DpuaIvNLjK32Qu0Ww6rb\">4.2 Holder Collateral-Free Cross-Chain Options</a> </p></li>\n<li><p>Security Analysis</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/preview/tvEU9LSYD1n72BFcPYRT\">5.1 Option Transfer Properties</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/preview/VAh9cc7JIcgJxxRg7Fpi\">5.2 Option Properties</a> </p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/EFqsX8ZQC0xIihPVO1wn\">Implementation</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/QiR69gdekeOcmxVXfMmx\">Related Work</a> </p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/8Xg0iL7cvxWaswxK1nyU\">Conclusion and Discussion, and References</a></p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\\n<strong>A.

To address this, we resort to economic incentives and let Bob control the exercise secret while Alice retains the right to penalize Bob. In addition to the usual collateral, Bob locks a valuable asset on 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑖𝑛𝐴 as a guarantee. If Bob fails to release the exercise secret when Alice exercises her right, she receives Bob’s guarantee as compensation, incentivizing Bob to cooperate.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-qq034g6.png\" alt=\"Figure 2: Collateral-Free Cross-Chain Swap Options if both Alice and Bob are honest, where Alice generates 𝐴 and 𝐻(𝐴), Bob generates 𝐵 and𝐻(𝐵), then they exchange𝐻(𝐴) and𝐻(𝐵).\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nSuppose Alice and Bob reach an agreement that Alice pays Bob 𝑃 as a premium on a chain denoted by 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑃 . The option takes effective at 𝑇𝐴 meaning that Alice obtains the right to exchange 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐴 for 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐵 before 𝑇𝐸. Bob’s guarantee is 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐺 .</p>\n<p>\\\nThe protocol involves two kinds of asset settlement: first for option establishment (or activation, we use them interchangably) and second for option exercise. We therefore introduce two secrets:</p>\n<p>\\\n(1) <em>Activation</em> secret 𝐴, used for Alice to pay the premium and activate the option; and (2) Exercise secret 𝐵, used for Alice to pay 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐴 to Bob in exchange for 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐵 when the option is exercised. Secret 𝐴 is generated by Alice and 𝐵 is generated by Bob.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe protocol is divided into two phases. Figure 2 shows the execution process of this protocol if both parties are honest.</p>\n<p>\\\n(1) <em>Setup phase</em>: Alice and Bob activate an option. Alice obtains option and Bob obtains premium. </p>\n<p>\\\n(2) <em>Exercise/Abandon phase</em>: Alice can either exercise the option or abandon it.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn the setup phase, Alice and Bob will establish this option similarly to a vanilla HTLC. Alice locks 𝑃 with a hashlock 𝐻(𝐴) in a contract on any chain. Bob creates two contracts, 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐴 on 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑖𝑛𝐴 and 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐵 on 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑖𝑛𝐵, which are used in the option. The option remains inactive until Alice reveals the activation secret 𝐴 before 𝑇𝐴, at which point the state updates to active and Bob gets Alice’s premium. 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐴 holds Bob’s guarantee, 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐺 , until the option expires. If Alice exercises the option and Bob fulfills his obligation by revealing the exercise secret 𝐵, 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐺 is refunded to Bob. If Bob fails to fulfills his obligation, 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐺 will be transferred to Alice. 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐵 locks Bob’s collateral, 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐵, using 𝐻(𝐵).</p>\n<p>\\\nI. <strong>Setup Phase.</strong></p>\n<p>\\\n(1) Alice randomly selects a secret 𝐴 as activation secret, and computes its hash value 𝐻(𝐴). Bob generates 𝐵 and 𝐻(𝐵), which serve as the exercise secret and hashlock. </p>\n<p>\\\n(2) Alice locks 𝑃 with hashlock 𝐻(𝐴) on the agree-upon𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑃 with timeout 𝑇𝐴 + Δ. </p>\n<p>\\\n(3) If Bob observes that Alice has honestly deposited the premium, Bob should, at any time before 𝑇𝐴 − Δ:</p>\n<p>\\\n(a) Create 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐴 on 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑖𝑛𝐴 and 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐵 on 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑖𝑛𝐵. These contracts are initially in an inactive state, and record the holder and writer, activation time 𝑇𝐴 and option expiration time 𝑇𝐸. </p>\n<p>\\\n(b) Escrow the guarantee 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐺 on 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑖𝑛𝐴, and lock principal 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐵 on 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑖𝑛𝐵 with hashlock 𝐻(𝐵). </p>\n<p>\\\n(4) If Alice observes that Bob has created contracts and made deposits, Alice reveals 𝐴 at 𝑇𝐴 on both chains to activate the option. If not, transaction aborts, Bob calls refund() and retrieves 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐺 and 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐵. Alice refunds 𝑃.</p>\n<p>\\\nII. <strong>Exercise/Abandon Phase.</strong></p>\n<p>\\\n(1) Exercise: If Alice wants to exercise the option at 𝑇𝐵 before expiration, she calls exercise() and deposits 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐴 into 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐴, then within one Δ: </p>\n<p>\\\n(a) If Bob reveals 𝐵 and calls fulfill() on 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐴, then he obtains both 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐴 and 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐺 . Upon observing 𝐵, Alice obtains 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐵 with 𝐵 from 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐵. </p>\n<p>\\\n(b) If Bob does not reveal 𝐵, Alice calls claim() on𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐴 after 𝑇𝐵 + Δ to receive 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐺 as compensation. </p>\n<p>\\\n(2) Abandon: If Alice does not call exercise() before or at 𝑇𝐸, then the option is abandoned and Bob can call refund() on 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐴 and 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐵 to refund 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐺 and 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐵.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>Timeouts</em>. The latest deadline 𝑇𝐵 is no later than 𝑇𝐸. If Bob fails to fulfill his obligations, then Alice receives 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐺 by 𝑇𝐸 + 2Δ. Therefore, the lock period for 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐺 in 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐴 is 𝑇𝐸 +Δ if Alice waives the option, or extends to𝑇𝐸 +2Δ if Alice exercises the option. Alice exercises the option and receives 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐵 by𝑇𝐸 +2Δ. Therefore, the lock period for 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐵 in 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐵 is 𝑇𝐸 + 2Δ.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>4.2.1 Integration</em>: Efficient Cross-Chain Options without Upfront Holder Collateral. We incorporate the efficient option transfer protocol to enable a collateral-free option transfer process. From the option transfer perspective, the roles of the holder and writer are reversed, as Bob owns the exercise secret. Bob deposits 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐺 and 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐵 in 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐴 and 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐵. In the transfer of Bob’s position, hashlock 𝐻(𝐵) must remain consistent.</p>\n<p>\\\nTake Bob transferring writer to Dave as an example. It is similar to the Protocol 4.1.1 with three notable differences. Suppose Bob reaches an agreement with Dave to transfer the writer position. Dave is able to buy Bob’s risky asset with its obligation at the price of 𝑊 𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟𝐹𝑒𝑒 before or at 𝑇𝑊 . First, Dave must choose a new hashlock as the exercise secret, and similarly, Bob needs to use his private key 𝑠𝑘𝐵 to sign Dave’s new hashlock 𝐻(𝐷), which means message 𝑚 = (𝑎, (Dave.𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑠, 𝐻(𝐷), 𝑝𝑘𝐷 )). Second, Alice can use Bob’s private key 𝑠𝑘𝐵 to reclaim 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐵 and guarantee, 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐺 . Third, if Alice wants to exercise the option and makes the deposit after Bob reveals the signature during the transfer process, the transfer continues, and Dave must forward the signature to obtain the writer’s position. Dave should fulfill his obligation and reveal the exercise secret at 𝑇𝑊 − Δ on 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐴.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-ko134ej.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nAs a result of the support for concurrent bidding, our protocol can effectively defend against phantom bid attack. In phantom bid attack, an adversary creates multiple virtual buyers who offer higher prices but do not finalize the transfer. In the previous protocol [12] which attempts to transfer the option to a buyer sequentially, in face of such an attack, the option holder/writer cannot sell their positions in a reasonable time since the virtual buyers are exhausting the option transfer window.</p>\n<p>\\\nWith our proposed protocol, an adversary option buyer cannot launch this attack. This is due to the use of a signature for option transfer settlement, rather than a hashlock used in the previous protocol. By this signature scheme, once a buyer is chosen by the seller, the option transfer can be finalized. There is no time window for the buyer to choose to finalize the option transfer or abort.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Authors:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) Zifan Peng, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (zpengao@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn);</p>\n<p>(2) Yingjie Xue, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (yingjiexue@hkust-gz.edu.cn);</p>\n<p>(3) Jingyu Liu, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (jliu514@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn).</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<hr />\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15724\">available on arxiv</a> under CC BY 4.0 license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"How Efficient Transfer Protocols Enable Collateral-Free Cross-Chain Options","url":"https://hackernoon.com/how-efficient-transfer-protocols-enable-collateral-free-cross-chain-options?source=rss","date":1735160411,"author":"EScholar: Electronic Academic Papers for Scholars","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<h2 id=\"tableoflinks\">Table of Links</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/Um9xbWbUFDMzkXakWgDh\">Abstract and Introduction</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/preview/dKHrehhbzuaTHtgJFbvy\">Preliminaries</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/preview/oyJxVXND1XBuIkqdQbUB\">Overview</a> </p></li>\n<li><p>Protocol</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/zubShKzeJXXu82JolWP1\">4.1 Efficient Option Transfer Protocol</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/preview/DpuaIvNLjK32Qu0Ww6rb\">4.2 Holder Collateral-Free Cross-Chain Options</a> </p></li>\n<li><p>Security Analysis</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/preview/tvEU9LSYD1n72BFcPYRT\">5.1 Option Transfer Properties</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/preview/VAh9cc7JIcgJxxRg7Fpi\">5.2 Option Properties</a> </p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/EFqsX8ZQC0xIihPVO1wn\">Implementation</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/QiR69gdekeOcmxVXfMmx\">Related Work</a> </p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/8Xg0iL7cvxWaswxK1nyU\">Conclusion and Discussion, and References</a></p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\\n<strong>A.

We first introduce the efficient transfer of an option in Section 4.1. Next, we outline how to achieve holder collateral-free cross-chain options in Section 4.2. Finally, we show the efficient, holder collateral-free option protocol.</p>\n<h3 id=\"41efficientoptiontransferprotocol\">4.1 Efficient Option Transfer Protocol</h3>\n<p><strong>Option Initialization</strong>. Firstly, we illustrate an efficient option transfer protocol in an HTLC-based option. Assume Alice and Bob initialize an HTLC-based option as the holder and writer respectively. In this option, Alice locks 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐴 on 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑖𝑛𝐴, intending to transfer it to Bob if a preimage of 𝐻(𝐴) is presented before 𝑇𝐸 + Δ. Bob locks 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐵 on 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑖𝑛𝐵, intending to transfer it to Alice if a preimage of 𝐻(𝐴) is presented before𝑇𝐸, where𝑇𝐸 is the expiration time of this option. Alice owns the preimage 𝐴. In addition, Alice performs 𝐾𝑒𝑦𝐺𝑒𝑛(1 𝜆 ) → (𝑝𝑘𝐴, 𝑠𝑘𝐴), which acts as a transfer key pair3 , which are used for DAPS and misbehavior detection. 𝑝𝑘𝐴 is recorded in both contracts. The transfer key is used by Alice when transferring ownership to another party. A signature generated by 𝑠𝑘𝐴 can be used to replace the contract holder, the hashlock, and the new transfer public key. Similarly, Bob creates a transfer key and records it on chains. Alice and Bob agree in advance on a value (e.g., a 256-bit random number) to serve as the message address 𝑎 recorded in the contracts for the DAPS. We take holder position transfer as an example to illustrate this transfer protocol.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>4.1.1 Transfer Holder’s Position.</em> Suppose Alice reaches an agreement with Carol to transfer the holder position on or before time 𝑇𝐻 , with a charge of 𝐻𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑒𝑟𝐹𝑒𝑒 on 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑖𝑛𝐶. Carol performs 𝐾𝑒𝑦𝐺𝑒𝑛(1 𝜆 ) → (𝑝𝑘𝐶, 𝑠𝑘𝐶) to generate a new transfer key pair. Carol deposits 𝐻𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑒𝑟𝐹𝑒𝑒 in 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐶. This contract requires a signature of 𝑚 = (𝑎, 𝑝), where message payload 𝑝 = (Carol.𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑠, 𝐻(𝐶), 𝑝𝑘𝐶), signed by 𝑠𝑘𝐴 to unlock and transfer the 𝐻𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑒𝑟𝐹𝑒𝑒 to Alice. Besides, 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐶 records 𝐻(𝐴), specifying that 𝐻𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑒𝑟𝐹𝑒𝑒 is refunded to Carol if Carol can reveal 𝐴 (meaning that Alice has exercised the option). Instead withdraw immediately, after Alice reveals a signature to redeem 𝐻𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑒𝑟𝐹𝑒𝑒 , she must wait for 3Δ to elapse. We refer to this period as the Withdrawal Delay Period. The protocol consists of two phases, Figure 1 illustrates the position transferring process:</p>\n<p>\\\n(1) <strong>Reveal Phase</strong>: Carol locks the transfer fee and Alice attempts to withdraw the transfer fee with her signature. </p>\n<p>\\\n(2) <strong>Consistency Phase</strong>: Carol forwards the signature to replace the holder and Alice withdraws the transfer fee after the withdrawal delay period.</p>\n<p>\\\nI. <strong>Reveal Phase</strong>.</p>\n<p>\\\n(1) Alice generates signature by 𝑆𝑖𝑔𝑛(𝑠𝑘𝐴,𝑚) → 𝜎𝑚, where 𝑚 equals to (𝑎, (Carol.𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑠, 𝐻(𝐶), 𝑝𝑘𝐶)). </p>\n<p>\\\n(2) If Alice wants to transfer her option to Carol, Alice sends 𝜎𝑚 in Contract𝐶 by invoking the function reveal() and wait for 3Δ (withdrawal delay period). If she does not like to complete the trade between Carol, she does not reveal 𝜎𝑚. The 𝐻𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑒𝑟𝐹𝑒𝑒 will be refunded to Carol after 𝑇𝐻 .</p>\n<p>\\\nII. <strong>Consistency Phase.</strong></p>\n<p>\\\n(1) Carol4 forwards 𝜎𝑚 to both 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐴 and 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐵 directly, attempting to call the function transferHolder() to replace the holder to Carol, the hashlock to 𝐻(𝐶), and holder’s transfer public key to 𝑝𝑘𝐶. </p>\n<p>\\\n(2) Alice calls withdraw() to obtain the 𝐻𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑒𝑟𝐹𝑒𝑒 in 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐶 after the withdrawal delay period.</p>\n<p>\\\nIf all parties perform honestly, Alice is able to receive 𝐻𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑒𝑟𝐹𝑒𝑒 and holder is changed to Carol. However, there are possible contingent events or dishonest scenarios:</p>\n<p>\\\n• If Alice exercises the option during the transfer process and reveals the preimage 𝐴 before 𝑇𝐻 , Carol can refund the 𝐻𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑒𝑟𝐹𝑒𝑒 from 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐶 using 𝐴 during the withdrawal delay period.</p>\n<p>\\\n• If different signatures with the same message address 𝜎𝑚′ ≠ 𝜎𝑚, are submitted on 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑖𝑛𝐴 and 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑖𝑛𝐵 (e.g., if Alice submits two different signatures or sells the option to multiple parties), any one can call 𝐸𝑥𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡(𝑝𝑘,𝑚′ , 𝜎𝑚′,𝑚, 𝜎𝑚) → 𝑠𝑘𝐴 to get 𝑠𝑘𝐴. 𝑠𝑘𝐴 is the secret transfer key of Alice. Whoever gets 𝑠𝑘𝐴 means that Alice misbehaves. We can use this as an evidence for fair settlement of funds.</p>\n<p>\\\n– Carol can call reclaim() and obtain the 𝐻𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑒𝑟𝐹𝑒𝑒 with 𝑠𝑘𝐴 during the withdrawal delay period. </p>\n<p>\\\n– Bob can use 𝑠𝑘𝐴 to claim both 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐴 and 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐵. If a signature has not been submitted, Bob can claim it anytime. If a signature has been submitted, Bob needs to send 𝑠𝑘𝐴 within one Δ after the signature submission.</p>\n<p>\\\n• If Carol reveals 𝜎𝑚 on only 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐴 or 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐵, Bob can forward the signature to the other contract.</p>\n<p>\\\nTimeouts. The transfer contract must be created no later than 𝑇𝐻 − 3Δ, and the reveal phase should be completed by 𝑇𝐻 − 2Δ to ensure that the option can be transferred to Carol at 𝑇𝐻 . In the consistency phase, if any misbehavior occurs, it should be reported to the contract by 𝑇𝐻 + Δ. If Bob does not claim assets on 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑖𝑛𝐴 and 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑖𝑛𝐵 with 𝑠𝑘𝐴, then it implies transfer complete. Overall, a total transfer time of 4Δ is required. In other words, the transfer protocol must initiate no later than 𝑇𝐸 − 4Δ. The unlocking condition for 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐶 is summarized in Table 2.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-s90343i.png\" alt=\"Table 2: Unlocking conditions of transferring position from Alice to Carol, where 𝑇 and 𝑇𝑅 are current time and the time that Alice reveals the signature.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n<em>4.1.2 How misbehaviors are handled securely in the protocol.</em> Here we show how this protocol handles misbehaviour and protect each party’s interests by ensuring a fair payoff for honest parties. A more rigorous analysis is shown in Appendix B.1. First, we consider each party acting maliciously on their own.</p>\n<p>\\\n• If Alice provides two different signatures to different buyers, as shown in 1, Bob can extract 𝑠𝑘𝐴 and submit it to obtain 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐴 and 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐵, and Carol can reclaim the transfer fee with 𝑠𝑘𝐴. In that case, Bob does not lose his 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐵 and Carol does not lose her transfer fee. </p>\n<p>\\\n• If Alice reveals𝐴 at the same time during the transfer process, as shown in 2, Carol can use 𝐴 to reclaim 𝐻𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑒𝑟𝐹𝑒𝑒. She does not lose anything. The option is exercised, and swap happens between Alice and Bob. </p>\n<p>\\\n• If Alice or Carol publishes one signature exclusively on either 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐴 or 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝐵, as shown in 3, Bob can forward this signature to another chain to make sure the hashlocks and option holders are consistent on two chains.</p>\n<p>\\\nNext, we consider scenarios where collusion exists.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-6w13459.png\" alt=\"Figure 1: Alice transfers holder position to Carol. The red dashed lines represent malicious activities, illustrated in Section 4.1.2.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n• If Alice and Bob collude, they can use 𝑠𝑘𝐴 or 𝐴 to withdraw 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐴 and 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐵 as shown in 4. Carol can observe 𝑠𝑘𝐴 or 𝐴 and withdraw 𝐻𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑒𝑟𝐹𝑒𝑒 during the withdrawal delay period. </p>\n<p>\\\n• If Alice and Carol collude, they use two signatures to change the hashlock. During the withdrawal delay period, Bob can obtain 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐴 and 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝐵 using the extracted 𝑠𝑘𝐴, which is reduced to 1. </p>\n<p>\\\n• If Bob and Carol collude, they cannot do anything harm. Since Alice will only reveal one valid signature, Alice will receive 𝐻𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑒𝑟𝐹𝑒𝑒 from Carol.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>4.1.3 Transfer Writer’s Position.</em> Transferring the writer’s position is similar but simpler because Bob does not possess the preimage of the hashlock. Bob, with the transfer key pair (𝑝𝑘𝐵, 𝑠𝑘𝐵), can sign the message 𝑚 = (𝑎, (Dave.𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑠, 𝑝𝑘𝐷 )) using 𝑠𝑘𝐵 to collect the transfer fee, where 𝑝𝑘𝐷 is a new transfer key for Dave. Transferring writer’s position does not update the hashlock used in the option exercise. Thus, Alice’s option is not influenced except the change of new option writer.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Authors:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) Zifan Peng, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (zpengao@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn);</p>\n<p>(2) Yingjie Xue, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (yingjiexue@hkust-gz.edu.cn);</p>\n<p>(3) Jingyu Liu, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (jliu514@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn).</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<hr />\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15724\">available on arxiv</a> under CC BY 4.0 license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>[3] Logically, the transfer key is not used for receiving coins as \"identities\" in blockchains. </p>\n<p>\\\n[4] Any party can forward this signature, as Alice may transfer ownership to any party.</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Elon Musk’s xAI lands $6B in new cash to fuel AI ambitions","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/25/elon-musks-xai-lands-billions-in-new-cash-to-fuel-ai-ambitions/","date":1735157820,"author":"Kyle Wiggers","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<p>Updated December 25, 12:21 p.m. Pacific: Added details of xAI&#8217;s valuation and Kingdom Holdings&#8217; contribution. xAI, Elon Musk&#8217;s AI company, has raised $6 billion in a Series C financing round.

Secret Message Embedding and Extraction Module</h3>\n<p>This module aims to embed the secret message during face swapping. The key problem is how to implement face swapping under the guidance of secret message. To our understanding, the latent features of the cover video encompass both identity and attribute feature. Face swapping essentially involves replacing the cover video’s identity with that of the reference image. Consequently, we embed the secret message into the identity feature of the reference image, formulated as follows:</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-r8a3uie.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nwhere λ is a hyper-parameter adjusting the influence of secret message on identity feature.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-3nb3uv9.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"33attackinglayer\">3.3. Attacking Layer</h3>\n<p>To bolster the robustness of our method for face-swapping videos in real-world scenarios, we design a attacking layer. This module simulates prevalent distortions encountered across social network platforms.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>JPEG Compression.</strong> JPEG compression involves a nondifferentiable quantization step due to rounding. To mitigate this, we apply Shin et al.’s method [53] to approximate the near-zero quantization step using function Eq. (6):</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-l7c3usk.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nwhere x denotes pixels of the input image. We uniformly sample the JPEG quality from within the range of [50, 100].</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Color Distortions.</strong> We consider two general color distortions: brightness and contrast. We perform a linear transformation on the pixels of each channel as the formula Eq. (7):</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-97d3uzb.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nwhere p(x) and f(x) refers to the distorted and the original image. The parameters a and c regulate contrast and brightness, respectively.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Color Saturation.</strong> We perform random linear interpolation between RGB and gray images equivalent to simulate the distortion.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Additive Noise.</strong> We use Gaussian noise to simulate any other distortions that are not considered in the attacking layer. We employ a Gaussian noise model (sampling the standard deviation δ ∼ U[0, 0.2]) to simulate imaging noise.</p>\n<h3 id=\"34lossfunction\">3.4. Loss Function</h3>\n<p>The proposed method ensures both high stego video quality and precise extraction of secret message. We achieve this by training the modules using the following losses.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-rze3u2f.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-l9f3urk.png\" alt=\"Table 1. Comparison Results on Extraction Accuracy. “-” means “Without Distortion”. (·) represents Bits Per Frame (BPF).Under different distortion scenarios, our method demonstrates superior performance in comparison.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Attribute Loss.</strong> We use the weak feature matching loss [26] to constrain attribute difference before and after embedding secret message. The loss function is defined as follows:</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-4wh3uv0.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nwhere <em>Dj</em> refers to the feature extractor of Discriminator D for the j-th layer, <em>Nj</em> is the number of elements in the j-th layer, and <em>H</em> is the total number of layers. Additionally, <em>h</em> represents the starting layer for computing the weak feature matching loss.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Adversarial Loss.</strong> To enhance performance, we use multiscale Discriminator with gradient penalty. We adopt the Hinge version of adversarial loss defined as follows:</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-yhi3u87.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Secret Loss.</strong> To address this, we use the Binary Cross-Entropy loss (BCE) as defined in Eq.

From a report: Such was evident Monday when Apple filed papers seeking to participate in the penalty phase of the Justice Department's antitrust case against Google. The search giant lost that case in August and is now battling the government over what remedies are appropriate. The DOJ has a long wish list that includes breaking the company up, forcing Google to make key search and user data available to potential rivals, and stopping the payments Google makes to partners such as Apple. \n\nThe payments to Apple alone now reportedly equate to about $20 billion annually, and make Google the default search engine on devices like the iPhone. Apple didn't confirm any specific amounts in its filing, but did say the company feels compelled to \"protect its commercial interests.\" Analysts widely estimate that the payments from Google are nearly pure profit for Apple, given relatively little incremental cost to generate that revenue.

RELATED WORK</h2>\n<p><strong>Image Steganography.</strong> Conventional image steganography methods primarily modify high-frequency components to embed secret message. The LSB substitution method [80] operates under the assumption that human eyes cannot perceive changes in the least significant bit of pixel values. HiDDeN [12] introduces an end-to-end trainable framework through an encoder-decoder architecture. SteganoGAN [31] employs dense encoders to enhance payload capacity. Wei et al [16] propose an advanced generative steganography network that can generate realistic stego images without using cover images. However, alterations in high-frequency components can be obliterated by common post-processing operations, such as JPEG compression or Gaussian Blur.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Video Steganography.</strong> Early video steganography usually modifies RGB or YUV color spaces for embedding secret message. Dong et al [33] observed that altering intra-frame modes in HEVC significantly affected video coding efficiency, while modifications to multilevel recursive coding units had minimal distortion impact. PWRN [35] employs a super-resolution CNN, the Wide Residual-Net filter (PWRN), to replace HEVC’s loop filter. Recently, He et al [36] devised an adaptive distortion function using enhanced Rate Distortion Optimization (RDO) and Syndrome-Trellis Code (STC) to minimize embedding distortion. However, these methods are struggle to handle various distortions that may arise in lossy channel transmission.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Visual Editing.</strong> Visual editing can encompass color correction on a single image, deletion, addition, or alteration of objects within the image, or even merging two photos to create an entirely new scene. In videos, visual editing might involve adding effects to specific frames, removing elements from the video to alter the scene, replacing one person’s face with another [26], also called face-swapping.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00652.pdf\">available on arxiv</a> under CC 4.0 license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Here's How Developers Can Ensure Sensitive Data Does Not Accidentally Reach Another Device","url":"https://hackernoon.com/heres-how-developers-can-ensure-sensitive-data-does-not-accidentally-reach-another-device?source=rss","date":1735153213,"author":"Doug","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<p>Have you ever received your neighbor’s package at your front door? (Maybe even accidentally opened it?)  Maybe you’ve had a sensitive voicemail left for someone else? As application developers, it is your job to ensure that sensitive data stored in your application does not get accidentally delivered to another party.</p>\n<p>\\\nThere are many techniques available to securely store customer data, and many are highly complex and difficult to implement.  Ideally, one could secure all of the customer data in a single database - keeping the design of the feature simple and secure.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Row-level security (RLS)</strong> is the ability to secure and control access to specific rows of data inside a database table. It is a powerful tool that allows you to store all your customer data in a single database without any concern about data leakage across accounts. However, correctly implementing RLS can be a tricky process involving combining login details with your database permissions. <a href=\"https://neon.tech/docs/guides/neon-authorize\">Neon Authorize</a> streamlines this process by automatically integrating authentication from your OAuth provider with your PostgreSQL database.</p>\n<p>\\\nNeon Authorize utilizes your existing authentication layer to identify every logged-in user and associates all the data in your database with their login credentials. This ensures that the data stored in the database can only be accessed by logged-in users—and that only logged-in users can see their data.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis tutorial will walk you through how to build a Remix app using Clerk as an authentication layer. <a href=\"https://clerk.com/\">Clerk</a> is a popular user authentication and management tool.  You’ll use Neon Postgres as your data layer and leverage Neon Authorize to secure all the data for each logged-in customer. Each row in the table will designate a userID, which is provided by Clerk. Only those authenticated with the userID can interact with data in the row.</p>\n<p>\\\nOur sample application is simple—it records every login into the RLS database, using the userID.

Although existing traditional video steganography methods display a certain level of security and embedding capacity, they lack adequate robustness against common distortions in online social networks (OSNs). In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end robust generative video steganography network (RoGVS), which achieves visual editing by modifying semantic feature of videos to embed secret message. We employ face-swapping scenario to showcase the visual editing effects. We first design a secret message embedding module to adaptively hide secret message into the semantic feature of videos. Extensive experiments display that the proposed RoGVS method applied to facial video datasets demonstrate its superiority over existing video and image steganography techniques in terms of both robustness and capacity.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong><em>Index Terms</em></strong>— Generative video steganography, Robust steganography, Semantic modification</p>\n<h2 id=\"1introduction\">1. INTRODUCTION</h2>\n<p>Steganography is the science and technology of embedding secret message into natural digital carriers, such as image, video, text, etc. Generally, the natural digital carriers are called “cover” and the digital media with secret message are called “stego”. Conventional image steganography methods [49, 12, 31] primarily modify high-frequency components to embed secret message. They commonly utilize methodologies such as pixel value manipulation or integrating secret message into the cover image before inputting it into an encoder for steganographic purposes.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn the past few years, as the rise of short video software applications like TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat, etc., video has become a suitable carrier for steganography. </p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-i583udx.png\" alt=\"Fig. 1. Methodology of RoGVS. We modulate semantic feature with secret message to edit videos, such as the identity feature in facial videos. Our RoGVS can generate highquality stego videos even in the presence of various distortions.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nTraditional video steganographic methods, utilizing direct pixel value manipulation [32], coding mapping [34], or adaptive distortion function [36], exploit video data redundancy for information hiding. Nevertheless, while successful in security and embedding capacity, these methods on modifying covert space can be erased by common post-processing operations easily. So they are vulnerable to mitigate diverse distortions that may occur in lossy channel transmission.</p>\n<p>\\\nVisual editing on videos can be seen as the process of modifying the semantic information of objects within them. Instead of hiding secret message in covert space, we embed secret message within semantic feature of videos for visual edition. The advanced semantic feature is less susceptible to distortions, making this method inherently robust. In order to improve the robustness of video steganography, we propose an end-to-end robust generative video steganography network (RoGVS), which consists of four modules, containing information encoding module, secret message embedding model, attacking layer, and secret message extraction module. For evaluation, we use face-swapping technology as an example to show the effectiveness of our method, while it can be easily extended to other applications. Comprehensive experiments have showcased that our method surpasses stateof-the-art techniques, attaining commendable robustness and generalization capabilities.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-7a93uui.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThe main contributions of our work are as follows: 1) We are the first to explore a novel generative video steganography method, which modifies semantic feature to embed secret message during visual editing instead of modify the covert space. This framework exhibits strong extensibility, serving as a new topic for the future development of the steganography field. 2) The proposed method is robust against common distortions in social network platform and the secret message can be extracted with high accuracy. 3) Our method achieves better security for anti-steganalysis than other state-of-the-art methods, which can effectively evade the detection of steganalysis system.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00652.pdf\">available on arxiv</a> under CC 4.0 license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Understanding Parallel Programming: Thread Management for Beginners","url":"https://hackernoon.com/understanding-parallel-programming-thread-management-for-beginners?source=rss","date":1735149717,"author":"threadmaster","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<p>\\\nI am Boris Dobretsov, and this is the fourth part of a series&nbsp;<strong>==Understanding Parallel Programming: A Guide for Beginners==.</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nIf you haven’t read the first three parts, have a look&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/understanding-parallel-programming-a-guide-for-beginners?ref=hackernoon.com\">Understanding Parallel Programming: A Guide for Beginners</a>,</strong>&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/understanding-parallel-programming-a-guide-for-beginners-part-ii\">Understanding Parallel Programming: A Guide for Beginners, Part II</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/understanding-threads-to-better-manage-threading-in-ios\">Understanding Threads to Better Manage Threading in iOS</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>\\\nToday we are going to continue exploring&nbsp;<strong>Threads</strong> and will discuss <strong>Thread management</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Thread execution flags</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Thread priority management tool</strong>. Let’s get started!</p>\n<h3 id=\"threadmanagement\">Thread Management</h3>\n<p>Sometimes it is not enough just to execute code in a separate thread, you need to manage it, start and cancel its execution.</p>\n<p>The simplest thing you can do with a thread is to <code>start</code> it.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"objectivec language-objectivec\">let thread1 = ThreadprintDemon()\nthread1.start()\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nThe thread will start and begin executing the main method. Sometimes beginners make a mistake: they create a thread and call its main method instead of start. In this case, the method will be executed in the thread in which it was called, without creating a separate one. Be careful. The second possible action with a thread is cancellation. To do this, call the <code>cancel</code> method.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"objectivec language-objectivec\">let thread1 = ThreadprintDemon()\nthread1.start()\nthread1.cancel()\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nThis method often causes mistakes among beginners. The fact is that it does not stop the flow, but only gives a stop command, which the developer must process himself during the flow execution.</p>\n<p>\\\nLet's create a thread that will perform an infinite task and experiment with it.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"objectivec language-objectivec\">class InfintyLoop: Thread {\n    override func main() {\n        while true {\n            print(\"😈\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nLet's create an instance of the thread, start it and stop it immediately.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"objectivec language-objectivec\">let thread1 = InfintyLoop()\nthread1.start()\nthread1.cancel()\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nThis is how beginners usually check the performance of the <code>cancel</code> method, and here's where the first pitfall awaits them. As a result of executing this code, there will be no messages in the console: the thread will stop, and we will think that the <code>cancel</code> method really stops the thread. But in fact, when calling <code>cancel</code> immediately after start, the thread will not even start executing. Let's change the code, add a 2-second pause between starting and stopping. During this time, the thread will have the time to start.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"objectivec language-objectivec\">let thread1 = InfintyLoop()\n\nthread1.start()\nsleep(2)\nthread1.cancel()\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"threadexecutionflags\">Thread execution flags</h3>\n<p>As you can see after executing this code, the demons have filled the console and show no intention of stopping their expansion. The stop method didn't work. Let's figure out why.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe <strong>Thread execution flags</strong> will help us with this:</p>\n<p>• <strong>isExecuting</strong> - Indicates if the thread is running.</p>\n<p>• <strong>isCancelled</strong> - Indicates if the thread has been stopped.</p>\n<p>• <strong>isFinished</strong> - Indicates if the thread has been completed.</p>\n<p>\\\nIt might seem like three flags are too much, as they all represent the state of the thread. However, that’s not true. The first flag,&nbsp;<code>isExecuting</code>, is the only one that reliably reflects the current state of the thread. The second,&nbsp;<code>isCancelled</code>, can be modified by the developer, so the thread's actual state may not align with this flag. The third flag,&nbsp;<code>isFinished</code>, indicates whether the thread has completed its execution.</p>\n<p>\\\nFor example, a thread that has not started executing has a state of <code>isExecuting - false</code>, but <code>isFinished</code> is also <code>false</code>, since it has not yet completed either.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>How do we use these flags to stop a thread?</strong></p>\n<p>We need to track the <code>isCancelled</code> flag in the thread code - if it becomes <code>true</code>, we simply stop the task. In this example, we can replace the while loop condition by writing <code>!isCancelled</code> instead of <code>true</code>. This way, the loop will only run until it is stopped.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"objectivec language-objectivec\">class InfintyLoop: Thread {\n    override func main() {\n        while !isCancelled {\n            print(\"😈\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nNow the start stop example will work as planned. This gives some flexibility: if your thread is performing an important task, you can allow it to finish gracefully rather than stopping it immediately upon receiving the command. The remaining flags are informational in nature, and there is no point in using them inside the thread. You can use them outside to see its state.</p>\n<h3 id=\"threadprioritymanagementtool\">Thread priority management tool</h3>\n<p>Threads help separate task execution, offloading the main thread and reducing UI lags. However, simply adding more threads doesn’t always resolve performance issues. Even with hundreds of threads, you're still limited by the device's resources. This means that while you can delegate logic to secondary threads, they may still compete for resources, impacting the performance of the main thread.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis is exactly what the <strong>thread priority management too</strong>l is for. With its help, you can prioritise certain threads based on their resource demands. For instance, a resource-intensive task like applying effects to an image can be moved to a separate thread with a lower priority, allowing the main thread to handle tasks that require immediate processor resources without freezing. Meanwhile, the image processing will be carried out when resources are available.</p>\n<p>\\\nLet’s create a new example: we’ll define two threads that each loop and print messages to the console. We'll increase the number of iterations to 100 to make the output more noticeable.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"objectivec language-objectivec\">class ThreadprintDemon: Thread {\n    override func main() {\n        for _ in (0..&lt;100) {\n            print(\"😈\")\n        }\n    }\n}\nclass ThreadprintAngel: Thread {\n    override func main() {\n        for _ in (0..&lt;100) {\n            print(\"😇\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nLet's run both threads at the same time. We'll see that demons and angels interchange. There may be more demons at the very beginning - this is because their thread was launched earlier.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"objectivec language-objectivec\">let thread1 = ThreadprintDemon()\nlet thread2 = ThreadprintAngel()\n\nthread1.start()\nthread2.start()\n\n😈\n😈\n😈\n😇\n😈\n😇\n😈\n😇\n😈\n😇\n😈\n😇\n😈\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nLet's change the priorities for the threads. There are 5 priorities:</p>\n<p>• <strong>UserInteractive</strong> - the highest priority. Used when the result is needed as soon as possible, preferably right now.</p>\n<p>• <strong>UserInitiated</strong> - lower priority. Used when the result is important, but a small delay is acceptable.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Utility</strong> - almost the minimum priority - for situations when the result can wait.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Background</strong> - the lowest priority, used for background tasks.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Default</strong> - the default priority, selected between <strong>userInitiated</strong> and <strong>Utility</strong>. Let's assign a low priority (<strong>Utility</strong>) to the thread with daemons, and the highest (<strong>userInteractive</strong>) to the thread with angels.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"objectivec language-objectivec\">let thread1 = ThreadprintDemon()\nlet thread2 = ThreadprintAngel()\n\nthread1.qualityOfService = .utility\nthread2.qualityOfService = .userInteractive\n\nthread1.start()\nthread2.start()\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nThe console output has changed dramatically. Now almost all angels are at the beginning, and demons are at the end. The thing is that all resources were given to the thread with angels, and the thread with demons was waiting for them to be available. This demonstrates priorities very well, but we have considered a situation where threads are very greedy, and a regular loop seeks to get all available resources.</p>\n<p>\\\nLet's add a pause to the loop: in this case, the thread will need few processor resources to execute.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"objectivec language-objectivec\">class ThreadprintDemon: Thread {\n    override func main() {\n        for _ in (0..&lt;100) {\n            print(\"😈\")\n            Thread.sleep(forTimeInterval: 1)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nclass ThreadprintAngel: Thread {\n    override func main() {\n        for _ in (0..&lt;100) {\n            print(\"😇\")\n            Thread.sleep(forTimeInterval: 1)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nlet thread1 = ThreadprintDemon()\nlet thread2 = ThreadprintAngel()\n\nthread1.qualityOfService = .utility\nthread2.qualityOfService = .userInteractive\n\nthread1.start()\nthread2.start()\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nEven though the thread priorities are still different, the console output has returned to the view where angels and demons interchange. This is because there are enough resources to run both threads at the same time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"runloopinthreads\">RunLoop in Threads</h3>\n<p>By default, RunLoop is only present in the main thread, and it is not automatically available in any other threads you create. This means that asynchronous code, timers, and certain notifications (like Realm) will not work properly in secondary threads. Without a RunLoop, a thread will terminate as soon as its code finishes executing. However, if you need to run timers or prevent a thread from closing too soon, you can create and start a RunLoop in that thread. The RunLoop is initialised as soon as you try to access it, ensuring the thread remains alive and can handle events like timers or asynchronous tasks.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe easiest way to access the <strong>Event Loop</strong> is to try to print the current loop to the screen.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"objectivec language-objectivec\">print(RunLoop.current)\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nAfter that, RunLoop will be created, even if it was not there. But it is in an inactive state. To start it, there is a <code>Run</code> method.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"objectivec language-objectivec\">RunLoop.current.run()\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nThe code above creates a RunLoop if it doesn't already exist and starts it. Once the event loop is running, it keeps the thread alive infinitely. However, after the loop is started, actions in the thread will only be executed if they are added to the RunLoop sources. This means that any asynchronous code or tasks need to be added to the <strong>Event Loop</strong> before it starts or from another thread. For example, if we try to set up a timer in a thread without an event loop, it won’t work because the thread won’t have an active loop to manage the timer. Let's look at a simple example that demonstrates this issue.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"objectivec language-objectivec\">class TimeThread: Thread {\n    override func main() {\n        // setup timer\n        Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: 0.25, repeats: true) { timer in\n            print(\"Tick\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nAdd a loop and the timer will start working.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"objectivec language-objectivec\">class TimeThread: Thread {\n    override func main() {\n        // setup timer\n        Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: 0.25, repeats: true) { timer in\n            print(\"Tick\")\n        }\n        // run loop\n        RunLoop.current.run()\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\n==Important==: in the example, the timer is added before the event loop is started. After that, RunLoop will block the thread with its loop, and the code execution will not continue. This is how the timer ==will not work==:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"objectivec language-objectivec\">class TimeThread: Thread {\n    override func main() {\n        // run loop\n        RunLoop.current.run()\n        // setup timer\n        Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: 0.25, repeats: true) { timer in\n            print(\"Tick\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nA thread started with a RunLoop will run indefinitely, as the loop will keep the thread alive. If you need to stop the thread after a certain period, you can set a time limit for the RunLoop to run.&nbsp; For example, for 20 seconds:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"objectivec language-objectivec\">RunLoop.current.run(until: Date() + 20)\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nThe event loop will start, but after 20 seconds the thread will be stopped. You can set any date as a limit, and even run the event loop for a week. Stopping the event loop is a bit more complicated with the <code>cancel</code> method. Typically, you create an infinite <code>while</code> loop that runs the RunLoop for one second if the thread is not stopped.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"objectivec language-objectivec\">while !isCancelled {\n    RunLoop.current.run(until: Date() + 1)\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nThe <code>while</code> loop will continue to execute until the thread receives a <code>cancel</code> command and its flag becomes <code>true</code>. Inside this loop, another loop runs for exactly one second. Afterward, it stops, and the loop checks whether there was a command to stop the thread. If not, the loop will start again.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In today's lesson, we explored <strong>Thread management</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Thread execution flags</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Thread priority management tool</strong>. We covered how to create and manage threads, including how to start and cancel them. We also discussed the common pitfalls, such as misusing the cancel method, and how to handle thread flags like&nbsp;<code>isExecuting</code>,&nbsp;<code>isCancelled</code>, and&nbsp;<code>isFinished</code>&nbsp;to manage thread states properly.  We looked at how to control thread priorities to optimise resource usage and prevent UI sluggishness, along with the importance of RunLoop in managing asynchronous tasks and timers within threads.</p>\n<p>Understanding these concepts is essential for efficient multithreading in iOS applications.</p>\n<p>\\\nNext time we will discuss <strong>Grand Central Dispatch</strong> library (<strong>GCD</strong>) and simplifying thread management.

Experiment and Demonstration</h2>\n<p>In this section, we present evaluation of some of the components above and demonstrate part of the end system.</p>\n<h3 id=\"51componentevaluation\">5.1. Component evaluation</h3>\n<p>Here, we present evaluations of lot zoning and lot item detection, for which our domain experts were able to create some gold standard for model building and evaluation. In both tasks, we use text classification and compare three machine learning algorithms: linear SVM, logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF). Therefore, we use the standard evaluation metrics for classification: Precision, Recall and F1. These are calculated as follows. Since each task has essentially two classes, we measure the scores for each class and take their average for reporting (macro-average).</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-3u034ao.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nTo evaluate lot zoning at page and table levels, we created two separate datasets. We asked domain experts from Vamstar to annotate a random collection of pages and tables extracted from our raw TED datasets into ‘relevant’ or ‘irrelevant’. This gave us a total of 781 pages, and 515 tables (multilingual in both cases). To evaluate lot item detection, we conducted two sets of experiments. First, using the TED database created by Vamstar, we identify the field containing values most similar to the description of lots and items, i.e., ‘lot and item descriptions’, split the values based on sentence boundaries and take the unique values. Values with less than 2 words or more than 20 words are excluded. This gives us a total of 18363 positive examples (multilingual). For negative examples, we apply the same process to the other four fields: ‘name and addresses’ of buyers, ‘notice title’, ‘short description’, and ‘contract criteria’. This gives us a total of 15632 negative examples. Combined together, we refer to this dataset as ‘lot item gold standard’. However, this only allows evaluating sentence-level classifiers, and the dataset does not necessarily represent the real documents that may describe lots in free-text and tables. Therefore, our second evaluation involves domain experts manually verifying the extractions (sentences, table rows) of the best model from 20 English tender notices for precision only. We refer to this dataset as ‘lot item verification’. Statistics of these datasets are shown in Table 1. Tables 2 ~ 3 show the evaluation results for different tasks respectively.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-6g134nc.png\" alt=\"Table 1. Dataset information for different task evaluation.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-5k234l2.png\" alt=\"Table 2. Evaluation results for lot zoning. Best results for each metric are highlighted in bold.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-pz3341p.png\" alt=\"Table 3. Evaluation results for lot item detection. Best results for each metric on the lot item GS are highlighted in bold.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThe results show that arguably, random forest is the most robust algorithm as it performed best on page-level lot zoning and lot item detection, while achieving comparable results on table-level lot zoning. We also conducted error analysis to understand where the automated methods failed.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn terms of the two ‘zoning’ tasks, we found three main causes that applied to both pages and tables. First, the low recall is typically due to ‘sparse’signals, such as a tender containing only one lot with very few items, described in a very short table or paragraph/list. Content as such is difficult to extract because the features generated for those text passages would be sparse compared to ‘denser’ pages or larger tables. Low precisions are primarily due to ‘noise’ in the domain lexicon, as some generic words (e.g. ‘solution’, ‘wrap’, ‘free’ as in ‘sugar free’) were retained and scored high. To address these issues, domain experts suggested developing ‘post processing’ rules to ‘recover’ passages that are potentially valid candidates for processing. For example, enforcing that at least one text passage must be extracted from each tender (thus those not making the classifier decisions may be recovered). Also, excluding unigrams in the domain lexicon could help address false positives. The third common cause of errors is due to content extraction from PDFs. As an example, arbitrary whitespaces are recognised between every letter when parsing some PDFs (e.g., ‘book’ becomes ‘b o o k’). This is an issue that is much harder to address, as it depends on the quality of PDFs as well as the third party extraction tool. This is an example of the practical challenges that industrial text mining and NLP projects can face while research may not as they deal with much higher quality data. This implies that in reality, system performance may be limited by some obstacles that are hard to overcome.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn terms of the lot item detection task, when examining the ‘lot item verification’ data, we find that the most common issue causing the decrease in precision is ‘noisy’ domain lexicon entries, as explained above. Further, complexity in the domain vocabulary also made the task challenging. For example, pharmaceutical ingredients sometimes have long names and are written in certain patterns, such as ‘17-alphahydroxyprogesterone’. For cases like these, domain experts suggested developing certain ‘regular expressions’ incorporating domain dictionaries. This implies that industrial text mining and NLP projects are often more complicated than tweaking a machine learning based method for performance measured by established standards. Practical solutions often rely on incorporating domain knowledge in various forms, oftentimes rules. This is consistent with earlier findings such as Chiticariu et al.

Discussion</h2>\n<p>In this section, we discuss lessons learned from the project that may potentially inform future research and practice. These will be covered from several angles: the different focus of industry project compared to research, the complexity of building a full NLP pipeline for heterogeneous data and its implication on the development, the dilemma of choosing between the more advanced NLP methods and those earlier classic methods, and the issue of training data in an industry context.</p>\n<h3 id=\"61theindustryfocusoftheproject\">6.1. The ‘industry’ focus of the project</h3>\n<p>There are very few studies that explicitly discuss the different focuses between industry and research projects and how these could impact the approach. Among these (Chiticariu et al., 2013; Suganthan et al., 2015; Krishna et al., 2016), it is widely acknowledged that the lack of training data and the associated cost of creating it, the fast development cycle, the need for interpretability of machine learning predictions, and the continuous update of the model due to evolving business needs and knowledge are factors that typically render a research-focused approach impractical. Industry projects focus on ‘problem solving’ in real world contexts with (often harsh) time and resource constraints, while research projects focus on ‘creative solutions’ to problems often studied in an ideal ‘lab’ environment that may not fully represent the reality.</p>\n<p>\\\nOur experience has supported most - if not all - of the viewpoints above. The industry project has a clear focus of developing a ‘proof-of-concept’ product within a time limit of one year and financial budget. The business partner needs to be able to take the finished product for further development and/or extension beyond the project. Analysis at the beginning of the project showed its ‘multi-task’ and ‘heterogeneous data’ nature. Combining all these factors, a typical research-driven approach aimed at developing ‘novel’solutions built on insights from rigorous critical evaluation of multiple baselines and state-of-the-art using research ‘benchmarks’ that may deviate from the real data, is infeasible. Instead, one lesson we learned is that one needs to opt for ‘tried and tested’ methods that have low ‘barriers’ to users, who may need to take the solution forward for future development.

I have to use a combination of screenshots and links because of the notorious Medium PAYWALL. I’m sure you won’t mind.

It’s a win-win for both parties, isn’t it?</p>\n<p>\\\nOne Medium writer actually did the math and came up with <a href=\"https://www.zuliewrites.com/blog/how-much-money-is-1000-views-worth-onnbspmedium\">$16 per 1K views</a>. I don’t know how much money the writer of the story (the screenshots I previously shared) eventually earned, but I know how much The Good Men Project made in 2023.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/LmkJG9CJCkeKroCwy3MciE5UHml1-wn3345r.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nIt’s more profitable to be an employee at The Good Men Project than a contributor to any of their publications on Medium.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Good Men Project was founded by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://goodmenproject.com/author/tom-matlack/\">Tom Matlack</a>&nbsp;in 2009.

System demonstration</h2>\n<p>In this section, we present the end system to demonstrate the ‘supplier risk profiles’ in action. First, informed by the evaluation above, we retrained the best-performing model - random forest - using all the labelled datasets for each component in the pipeline. After retraining all models, we apply our workflow to the entire raw TED dataset. This contains roughly 3.3 million healthcare related tender notices (with contract awards) covering 2011 to 2022, involving over 167 thousands unique suppliers, 86 thousands buyers, with higher than $2 trillion in monetary value. Processing this massive dataset using our workflow explained above allowed us to create the biggest healthcare procurement database to date. We then run queries to obtain data from the database to calculate the above-mentioned metrics for each supplier. We show a few examples in screenshots below.</p>\n<p>\\\nFigure 8 shows the supplier risk profile in terms of ‘ability to supply’ and ‘economic risk’ for Bausch &amp; Lomb, based on their contracts won between 2011 and 2022. The line chart on the left shows a number of ‘buyer’ metrics (BM) selected for review, such as: ‘buyer countries’ that measures a supplier’s global reach by considering countries they won contract in; ‘buyers - moving average’ that considers the number of active buyers for a supplier; and ‘buyers - yearly participation’ that considers the number of active buyers for supplier each year. The line chart on the right aggregates these selected metrics to show an overall trend. Figure 9 shows the supplier risk profile (also ‘ability to supply’ and ‘economic risk’) for Siemens covering the same time period, but using a mixture of ‘lot’ and ‘buyer’ metrics (LM and BM). For example, ‘buyer - churn/retention rate’ that measures the change in the supplier’s clients (based on the number of new buyers they had and lost during each time period); ‘lots - average duration days’ and ‘lots - duration days’ looking at lot duration in days to understand lot delivery time frames. Each figure demonstrates risks of a specific supplier from different perspectives, hence allowing users to thoroughly evaluate a supplier.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-qf034h8.png\" alt=\"Figure 8.

Comparison of several small suppliers’ risk profiles.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nFigure 10 and 11 compare global suppliers in a single view. Generally, a straight line with little fluctuations is desirable as that indicates little change in risks over time. We can notice that in Figure 10, most suppliers selected for review have relatively little change in terms of their risks. This is mainly due to them being large, established suppliers that tend to win a continuous stream of contracts over time. However, some suppliers had more fluctuations in their risk indices compared to others, suggesting they may be riskier choices to buyers. Figure 11 compares several smaller suppliers, and we can see that their risk patterns are much more erratic, due to a lack of continuity in their track record.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Authors:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) Ziqi Zhang*, Information School, the University of Sheffield, Regent Court, Sheffield, UKS1 4DP (Ziqi.Zhang@sheffield.ac.uk);</p>\n<p>(2) Tomas Jasaitis, Vamstar Ltd., London (Tomas.Jasaitis@vamstar.io);</p>\n<p>(3) Richard Freeman, Vamstar Ltd., London (Richard.Freeman@vamstar.io);</p>\n<p>(4) Rowida Alfrjani, Information School, the University of Sheffield, Regent Court, Sheffield, UKS1 4DP (Rowida.Alfrjani@sheffield.ac.uk);</p>\n<p>(5) Adam Funk, Information School, the University of Sheffield, Regent Court, Sheffield, UKS1 4DP (Adam.Funk@sheffield.ac.uk).</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<hr />\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03458\">available on arxiv</a></strong> under CC BY 4.0 license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Creating Supplier-Centric Contract Records with XML Parsing and Data Joining","url":"https://hackernoon.com/creating-supplier-centric-contract-records-with-xml-parsing-and-data-joining?source=rss","date":1735143310,"author":"Text Mining","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<h2 id=\"tableoflinks\">Table of Links</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/Atw2lXsJWRm7osebJVC4\">Abstract and Introduction</a></strong> </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Domain and Task</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/gvqItA7L7XcwOscgpVRv\">2.1.

XML parsing, data joining, and risk indices development</h2>\n<p>So far, we have explained how we extract missing lot and item information from tender attachment documents. As per Figure 6, our workflow also parses tender and award XMLs to extract other structure information about contract awards. This information is then joined with the lot and item information to create supplier-centric contract award records. This is a relatively straightforward process that we will only briefly explain here. For each award XML, one contract award record is created for a unique supplier-buyer pair. The supplier information is extracted from the award XML; while the buyer in the award XML is matched to that in the tender XML through name matching. This allows us to integrate additional buyer information from the tender XML. Contractual terms such as the start and end dates and lot quantity and values are also available from the award XML. However, where the award XML has missing lot and item information, we use the lot references to map to the extracted lot and item information from the tender attachment documents. Through this process, we populate our database with the schema partially shown in Figure 4.</p>\n<p>\\\nUsing this database, we can retrieve a particular supplier and its contract history for particular products. We can also use this information to calculate quantitative ‘indices’ that summarise individual suppliers’ risks from a buyer point of view. We introduce a number of metrics we developed in the current proof-of-concept. Once again, these are proprietary and therefore we focus on explaining the intuitions behind instead of revealing the mathematical calculations.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn total, we define 21 metrics that can be organised from two angles. For the first, we divide metrics into two types: one that measures a supplier’s ability to supply different ranges of products, the other that measures a supplier’s economic risk, taking into account their historical contract capacity and currently ‘active’ contracts. For the second, we define five sub-groups: ‘Product Metric (PM)’, ‘Buyer Metric (BM)’, ‘Location (LocM)’, ‘Lot Metric (LM)’, and ‘Value Metric (VM)’. PMs measure the ability of a supplier to supply a number of different products, or indications of ‘divergence’ of their portfolio. These monitor each year’s performance by taking into account their product portfolios and contract fulfilment track record. Factors included are, for example, the number of different types of products they supply each year; how this changes over time (increasing, or decreasing to a smaller number of products); quantity of specific types of products delivered to buyers. BMs measure the extent to which suppliers are generally able to retain their customers (e.g., churn and retention). LocMs measure the supplier’s ability to sell goods across countries and therefore, considers geographical coverage by their historical contracts. LMs measure at tender lot level the suppliers’ ability to participate in multiple contracts over time. This accounts for contract durations and helps us infer supplier stock levels. VM measures financial capacity and different value propositions suppliers can offer and participate in. For example, these may look at the fluctuations in a supplier’s contract capacity to identify risks of inability to supply. When a supplier signs a contract with a value (or quantity) that is significantly beyond its ‘norm’ (e.g., based on the average and range of contract values). The intuition is that signing contracts significantly deviating from the ‘norm’ can represent a risk of inability to supply. We will demonstrate the end system that allows exploring these risk indices and supplier profiles in the next Section.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Authors:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) Ziqi Zhang*, Information School, the University of Sheffield, Regent Court, Sheffield, UKS1 4DP (Ziqi.Zhang@sheffield.ac.uk);</p>\n<p>(2) Tomas Jasaitis, Vamstar Ltd., London (Tomas.Jasaitis@vamstar.io);</p>\n<p>(3) Richard Freeman, Vamstar Ltd., London (Richard.Freeman@vamstar.io);</p>\n<p>(4) Rowida Alfrjani, Information School, the University of Sheffield, Regent Court, Sheffield, UKS1 4DP (Rowida.Alfrjani@sheffield.ac.uk);</p>\n<p>(5) Adam Funk, Information School, the University of Sheffield, Regent Court, Sheffield, UKS1 4DP (Adam.Funk@sheffield.ac.uk).</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<hr />\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03458\">available on arxiv</a></strong> under CC BY 4.0 license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"The HackerNoon Newsletter: Why the Race to AGI is Humanitys Defining Moment (12/25/2024)","url":"https://hackernoon.com/12-25-2024-newsletter?source=rss","date":1735142715,"author":"Noonification","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"\n              \n        <p><strong>How are you, hacker?</strong></p>\n        <br />\n        <p>🪐 What’s happening in tech today, December 25, 2024?</p>\n        <br />\n        <p>\n          The\n          <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/noonification\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> HackerNoon Newsletter</a>\n          brings the HackerNoon \n          <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">homepage</a>\n          straight to your inbox.\n          <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/on-this-day\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">On this day,</a>\n          \n            <strong>NASA Launched The James Webb Space Telescope</strong> in 2021,  <strong>Gorbachev Resignd and Ukraine left the Soviet Union </strong> in 1855 AD,  <strong>Huygens Probe Landed on Titan's Surface</strong> in 2004, \n          \n          and  we present you with these top quality stories. \n          \n            From \n        <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsoft-defeats-proposal-asking-company-to-add-bitcoin-to-its-balance-sheet\" class=\"eventTitle\"><strong>Microsoft Defeats Proposal Asking Company to Add Bitcoin to Its Balance Sheet</strong></a>\n       to \n        <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/googled-tricked-openai-into-thinking-it-was-ahead-it-wasnt\" class=\"eventTitle\"><strong>Googled Tricked OpenAI Into Thinking It Was Ahead (It Wasnt)</strong></a>,\n       let’s dive right in.\n          \n        </p>\n      \n              \n          <h2><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/googled-tricked-openai-into-thinking-it-was-ahead-it-wasnt\">Googled Tricked OpenAI Into Thinking It Was Ahead (It Wasnt)</a></h2>\n          <p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/IqkQes3OEWdNt1lODV0ZMI9jWNZ2-mx837ys.jpeg\" alt /> </p>\n          <br />\n          <p>By <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/u/hacker661972\">@hacker661972</a> [ 11 Min read ] Google has released a cheap, fast and highly capable model to build agentic flows. <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/googled-tricked-openai-into-thinking-it-was-ahead-it-wasnt\">Read More.</a></p>\n        \n          <h2><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/why-the-race-to-agi-is-humanitys-defining-moment\">Why the Race to AGI is Humanitys Defining Moment</a></h2>\n          <p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/9SBj6OzMvXOEhDxTjjuu75pLYnp1-27237v7.jpeg\" alt /> </p>\n          <br />\n          <p>By <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/u/thomascherickal\">@thomascherickal</a> [ 6 Min read ] If you ever wondered why AGI is so scary for some scientists, while others are pursing it with passion -

Yet DeFi’s first wave of protocols opted to sacrifice flexibility for predictability, creating a tension between safety and market development that lies at the heart of onchain credit’s growing pains.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis tension is now reaching a breaking point, while DeFi lending like <a href=\"https://compound.finance/\">Compound</a> and <a href=\"https://app.aave.com/\">Aave</a> have built billion-dollar markets around this premise, yet as the crypto market evolves while traditional yields decline, new dynamics emerge through a fundamental shift in value capture and distribution. The rise of liquid staking derivatives, real-world assets (RWA), institutional demand and even memecoin craze creates an unprecedented need for less “paternalistic” financial lending infrastructure, the idea that sophisticated users inevitably craft complex lending strategies that far outpace the rigid parameters of existing protocols, yet their only path to implementing changes runs through slow, politically-charged governance processes.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhile the market has matured, the reality of established DeFi lending faces mounting challenges - rigid frameworks and limited collateral support no longer suffice for today's diverse asset landscape long tail assets. The <a href=\"https://www.usv.com/writing/2016/08/fat-protocols/\">Fat Protocol</a> thesis back then argued a clear picture: value in crypto would primarily accrue at the protocol layer. It made sense at the time - we all nodded along, thinking about how Bitcoin and Ethereum had massive market caps while applications built on top struggled to capture similar value. But today DeFi lending has thrown a wrench. The reality is messier, more complex, and forces us to rethink everything - most critically, how these systems should be structured in the first place to drive maximum value capture.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theoriginaldichotomymonolithicvsmodular\">The Original Dichotomy: Monolithic vs Modular</h2>\n<p>Early protocols were recognized as a monolithic paradigm, controlling entire lending stacks - a single unified pool holding major assets, with parameters controlled by centralized governance. This approach represents a <a href=\"https://morpho.mirror.xyz/KCMBXBYPOE-aYvPuu5vSVzUozoO98QqZsYHvx5TYz5c\">decentralized brokers</a> approach to DeFi lending where a defined set of individuals made all key decisions - controlling everything from liquidity provision to risk management.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis model spawned numerous imitators, with Aave, Compound and MakerDAO emerging as dominant players. The approach initially proved successful because it solved two critical problems: bootstrapping liquidity and managing risk in DeFi's early, uncertain days.</p>\n<p>\\\nAs lending transitions to onchain collateral, margins naturally compress due to increased market efficiency. The complexity of monolith isn’t just an operational challenge - it represents a fundamental scaling constraint for <a href=\"https://research.2077.xyz/wildcat-finance\">DeFi lending</a>. The monolithic model suffers from several structural constraints:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://x.com/TheiaResearch/status/1832002457234292976\">Risk Contagion</a></strong>: Pooled capital means losses in one asset can affect all lenders</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://x.com/TheiaResearch/status/1832002457234292976\">Reputational Constraints</a></strong>: Every parameter change risks the platform's entire reputation</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://morpho.mirror.xyz/EzJu5-3zdzlqdwP8kwnYwVYZD2iONz5PF4ohe--VPyE\">Innovation Bottleneck</a></strong>: Conservative governance limits support for long-tail assets, trust assumption much larger than we think</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://morpho.mirror.xyz/EzJu5-3zdzlqdwP8kwnYwVYZD2iONz5PF4ohe--VPyE\">Capital Inefficiency</a></strong>: Risk parameters must accommodate the lowest common denominator.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\\nThe model inherently resists supporting innovative lending products or long-tail assets, regardless of their potential merit, thus pushing the market toward modular solutions or what might be called the free market approach to DeFi lending. But something worth noting, <a href=\"https://www.euler.finance/blog/protocols-vs-products?ref=blog.gearbox.fi\">not all modularity is created equal</a>. We're seeing two types emerge:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Chaotic Modularity</strong>: Where each protocol has its own governance and fee structure, effectively replacing traditional middlemen with \"middle-protocols.\" Think about trying to build a leveraged position - you're paying fees to lending protocols, DEXs, and various other middleware, each with their own governance making decisions that affect your transaction.</li>\n<li><strong>Cohesive Modularity</strong>: Where protocols work together seamlessly while maintaining their independence. Creating systems where primitive protocols provide the foundation, but with abstraction layers that ensure a smooth user experience.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\\nEuler v2 represents this paradigm shift toward cohesive modularity. The lack of flexibility and a competitive marketplace for users to create customized lending pools with tailored parameters has created a gap that they leverage to <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/euler-finance-exploit-comeback?nocache=\">emerge from the shadows</a>. This transforms lending from a protocol-dominated activity to a market-driven one, where different vault designers&nbsp; compete for capital based on their performance and innovation.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/WSQJfCSXOxWphTNQ7sneVvhdWGu1-2024-12-25T16:00:14.737Z-v63bwsp61nn0beccxuwmzlmd\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nModularization isn't just architectural - it's a response to the inherent nature of lending as an <a href=\"https://jessewalden.com/incomplete-contracts-and-scaling-crypto/\">incomplete contract</a> system requiring human judgment for critical decisions. The result is a new ecosystem where value distributes among specialized players: risk managers like <a href=\"https://www.gauntlet.xyz/\">Gauntlet</a> and <a href=\"https://re7.capital/\">Re7Capital</a> monetizing their expertise, oracle providers competing for accuracy, and liquidation specialists optimizing for different collateral types.</p>\n<p>\\\nYet as markets abhor complexity, we're seeing a <a href=\"https://doseofdefi.substack.com/p/modular-lending-more-than-a-meme?triedRedirect=true\">rebundling wave</a> through aggregation layers, suggesting that DeFi lending's future lies not in choosing between modular and monolithic approaches, but in understanding which approach best serves specific market niches while maintaining the core promise of trustless, permissionless finance. And nowhere is this story more compelling than in Euler's groundbreaking approach to modularity.</p>\n<h2 id=\"aglimpseintothestateofeuler\">A Glimpse into the State of Euler</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/WSQJfCSXOxWphTNQ7sneVvhdWGu1-2024-12-25T16:00:14.784Z-vv6lsgg0jsswswk5v8bv323d\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nAfter a rebuilding era and extensive <a href=\"https://www.euler.finance/blog/securing-euler\">security audits</a>, Euler's relaunch to modularity at core showed an inflection point in early November, catalyzing an aggressive upward trajectory that culminated in $74.59m net deposits, marking approximately a 490% increase in just two weeks (Fig 1).</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/WSQJfCSXOxWphTNQ7sneVvhdWGu1-2024-12-25T16:00:14.786Z-uijtexfn5ufylid07exj8xc7\" alt=\"Fig 1.

Where v1 followed the traditional approach of a single, upgradeable protocol, v2 splits functionality between two primary components: the Ethereum Vault Connector (EVC) and&nbsp; Euler Vault Kit (EVK).</p>\n<h3 id=\"vaultseverywhere\">Vaults Everywhere</h3>\n<p>The EVC and EVK serve as a comprehensive development framework built on <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-4626/\">ERC-4626</a>. ERC-4626 is an emerging standard for contracts that implement yield-bearing vaults, which will play a crucial role in the future lending market for borrowing and storing collateral. Think of it like <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/\">ERC-20</a>, the token that we use every day, but designed for yield-generating tokens. Just as ERC-20 standardized tokens and enabled Uniswap to seamlessly integrate any token, ERC-4626 aims to standardize yield-bearing vaults.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe key benefit of the standard is that one integration can work with multiple protocols and applications—write once, use everywhere. There are two main types of vaults in the ERC-4626 context:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Active Vaults</strong>: Traditional vaults where depositors put in funds and the vault actively manages them (reinvesting, seeking yield, etc.)</li>\n<li><strong>Passive Vaults</strong>: Vaults that hold funds and wait for borrowers to come and borrow them (similar to Compound's model)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\\nWhen users deposit into a vault, they receive shares in return. These shares:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are ERC-20 compatible tokens</li>\n<li>Don't rebase (amount stays constant)</li>\n<li>As interest accrues, each share is redeemable for&nbsp; a growing quantity of the underlying asset</li>\n<li>Value is determined by exchange rate (total assets/total shares)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nThe remaining question about this standard is: how do you prevent users from simply withdrawing collateral after taking a borrow? Vaults need to coordinate—they need to work together in some way—and that’s where the EVC comes in.</p>\n<h3 id=\"evctrafficcontrollerbetweenvaults\">EVC: Traffic Controller between Vaults</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://evc.wtf/\">EVC</a> is an interoperability protocol that enables vault creators to connect their vaults together such that they developers can more efficiently chain vaults together to pass information and interact with one another. The key innovation is its non-invasive approach - it works as a coordination layer without requiring significant modifications to existing systems. This makes it particularly valuable for integrating with both new and existing DeFi protocols.</p>\n<h4 id=\"corearchitecture\">Core Architecture</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Authentication Layer (EVC)</strong>: Handles the \"who\" - verifying identities and permissions of users and contracts interacting with the system</li>\n<li><strong>Authorization Layer (Vaults)</strong>: Handles the \"what\" - determining if actions are allowed based on their own rules and states.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This separation makes the system more modular and easier to reason about from a security perspective. For example, when a user attempts to withdraw collateral, the EVC verifies it's actually the user making the request, while the vault determines if the withdrawal would violate any lending terms.</p>\n<h3 id=\"keycomponents\">Key Components</h3>\n<h4 id=\"collateralset\">Collateral Set</h4>\n<p>The collateral set is essentially a user's portfolio of vaults they've designated as collateral. Think of it as a list of assets a user is willing to put up as security for loans. Users have full control over managing this set - they can add or remove vaults (when not controlled by a loan), and each vault must be ERC-4626 compatible. This standardization ensures consistent behavior across different types of collateral.</p>\n<h4 id=\"controllersystem\">Controller System</h4>\n<p>The controller system is the heart of EVC's security model. By limiting each account to one controller at a time, it creates clear lines of authority and prevents conflicts. When a user takes out a loan, the lending vault becomes their controller, giving it authority to prevent collateral withdrawals that would make the loan unsafe. This mirrors traditional lending markets where you can't withdraw collateral until you've repaid your loan. The key difference is that this is handled at the protocol level through smart contracts.</p>\n<p>\\\nSome key features of the EVC include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Unified Liquidity and Interoperability</strong>: Protocols can accept deposits from other vaults as collateral.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Standardized Liquidation System</strong>: Controllers interact with positions through standard vault functions, reducing attack vectors.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Flexibility in Asset Properties</strong>: The EVC allows for the creation of vaults backed by various asset classes, including NFTs, Real World Assets (RWAs), uncollateralized IOUs, or synthetics.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Batch Operations</strong>: A powerful feature that allows complex operations to be executed atomically, improving gas efficiency and user convenience for position management without requiring traditional techniques like flash loans. Think of it as a sophisticated version of a multi-call transaction, but with added benefits.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Operators</strong>: Users can attach external contracts to act on behalf of a sub-account, unlocking powerful functionality. Unlike controllers, operators can be removed at any time, making them safer for automation tasks. This enables sophisticated trading strategies like stop-losses, take-profit orders, and trailing stops to be implemented as smart contracts that can manage positions automatically.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Sub-Accounts</strong>: Users can create multiple isolated positions meaning positions and risks can be segregated within their single owner account to maintain up to 256 virtual accounts under their main address and easily rebalance collateral/liabilities between them. This is particularly useful for users who want to implement different strategies or manage risks separately.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Standardized Account Liquidity Checks</strong>: Defers liquidity checks and vault status checks, preventing transient violations from causing failures.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Security Considerations</strong>: &nbsp;Vaults must explicitly trust collateral vaults via whitelist; operators require careful vetting.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/WSQJfCSXOxWphTNQ7sneVvhdWGu1-2024-12-25T16:00:15.356Z-yfopp8gsnszqvid7ov82xkbf\" alt=\"Fig 4 .

EVK emerges as a sophisticated implementation of this ERC-4626 standard, but goes beyond basic vault functionality.</p>\n<p>\\\nAt deployment, vaults can be created as either upgradeable or immutable through a factory contract, providing flexibility in governance models. The system employs internal balance tracking for gas optimization and implements a virtual deposit mechanism to handle precision and rounding edge cases - critical for assets with varying decimal places. This approach solves historical challenges in lending protocols where precision loss could lead to accounting discrepancies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"corearchitecture-1\">Core Architecture</h2>\n<h3 id=\"vaultgovernancemodels\">Vault Governance Models</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Managed Vaults</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The managed vault system provides flexibility in governance through different control mechanisms. When creating a vault, the deployer becomes the initial governor and can retain this control, ideally through a multisig or governance contract. This model allows for active management of vault parameters and settings, enabling responsive adjustments to market conditions. Multiple vaults can be managed by the same multisig, facilitating cluster-like lending products, or they can be individually controlled for more isolated management.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Immutable Vaults</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>At the opposite end of the governance spectrum are immutable vaults, created when the governor address is set to zero. These vaults have fixed configurations that cannot be changed after deployment, providing users with certainty about the vault's behavior. This immutability can be particularly attractive for users who prefer predictable, unchanging protocols.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Hybrid Governance</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Between fully managed and immutable vaults lies a spectrum of hybrid governance strategies. These can be implemented through proxy contracts that limit governance actions to specific functions, such as pausing operations or adjusting LTV ratios. These proxy contracts can include timelock mechanisms and other controls, providing a balance between flexibility and stability.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe EVK features a robust security architecture centered on vault share pricing protection. It implements internal balance tracking and virtual deposits to protect against manipulation attempts and pool donation attacks. The system's LTV (Loan-to-Value) ramping mechanism introduces a thoughtful approach to risk management, allowing existing positions to adapt gradually to parameter changes while applying new limits immediately to fresh positions, effectively balancing borrower protection from sudden liquidations while maintaining protocol safety&nbsp; (Fig 5).</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/WSQJfCSXOxWphTNQ7sneVvhdWGu1-2024-12-25T16:00:15.296Z-kctc6h5qi6swdziz6a25gwru\" alt=\"Fig 5 . LTV Ramping. Source: Euler Docs\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nA key innovation is the nested vault system, enabling vault shares to serve as underlying assets for other vaults. This creates a composable architecture where users can stack yields across multiple vault layers - for instance, an eUSDC vault token holder benefits from both eUSDC yields and additional lending returns (Fig 6).</p>\n<p>\\\nThis feature particularly helps new lending pools bootstrap liquidity by offering competitive yields from launch.

It is <a href=\"https://github.com/euler-xyz/fee-flow/blob/main/docs/whitepaper.md\">agnostic to the underlying protocol</a> it accrues fees from, and can <a href=\"https://github.com/euler-xyz/fee-flow/blob/main/docs/whitepaper.md\">convert fees into kind of token</a>. Unlike the traditional “dump everything in treasury and figure it out later” approach, it introduces a reverse Dutch auction system that solves the asset consolidation problem that has plagued DeFi.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis system periodically auctions accumulated fees by systematically reducing prices, providing a MEV-resistant and efficient path to convert various assets into unified tokens like ETH, stETH, USDC, or potentially EUL, while automatically allocating a portion of generated interest to fees, creating a passive income stream for vault creators and ensuring the Euler DAO receives its share.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe entire system is built on the ERC-4626 standard, ensuring seamless integration with the broader DeFi ecosystem while maintaining backward compatibility with <a href=\"https://research.2077.xyz/making-crosschain-tokens-fungible-part-1\">ERC-20 tokens</a>. The implementation uses non-rebasing shares for predictable integrations and employs a sophisticated exchange rate mechanism that considers both actual token balances (cash) and outstanding loans for accurate share pricing. This comprehensive approach, combined with virtual share protection mechanisms, creates a secure and efficient system for managing yielding vaults.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/WSQJfCSXOxWphTNQ7sneVvhdWGu1-2024-12-25T16:00:15.177Z-gzl78behoqczmiyahoom7xj0\" alt=\"Fig 7 . EVK Vault Creation & Usage Flow. Source: Euler Docs\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nAt the end of this technical discussion, tailor your own risk. Euler uses a modular ecosystem of vaults to give you full flexibility in your lending experience:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Core</strong>: Traditional governed lending (Euler v1)</li>\n<li><strong>Edge</strong>: Permissionless lending markets with flexibility of parameters</li>\n<li><strong>Escrow</strong>: Support for any ERC20 as collateral, but without yield-generating.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nThe two technological architectures behind it act as base layer lending infrastructure: the EVC serves as the protocol's connective tissue, orchestrating vault interactions and position management, while the EVK emerges as a sophisticated toolkit for crafting bespoke lending markets. At their core, both components create what could be DeFi's most comprehensive lending framework yet - spanning from traditional DAO-governed markets to cutting-edge permissionless deployments.</p>\n<p>\\\nEuler's architectural approach suggests a future where lending markets aren't just isolated pools, but composable, interoperable building blocks. This vision of lending could fundamentally reshape how we think about capital efficiency in DeFi.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lookingaheaddefiasatrueproductmarketfit\">Looking ahead: DeFi as a True Product-Market Fit</h2>\n<p>DeFi lending, despite its maturity relative to emergent sectors like liquid staking, restaking, high-yield bearing stablecoins and others, stands as one of the few verticals demonstrating genuine product-market fit without succumbing to ponzinomics. This foundation suggests continued innovation is not just possible but probable in upcoming market cycles</p>\n<p>However, the true test lies in adoption. While Euler has addressed technical challenges and security concerns, key questions remain:</p>\n<h3 id=\"productmarketalignment\">Product-Market Alignment</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>As protocols accumulate increasingly diverse fee streams, how viable is Fee Flow's uncapped token approach when gas optimization becomes critical at scale?</li>\n<li>Does the market need this level of complexity, or will minimalist approach win?</li>\n<li>Who is the true target user: sophisticated traders or lending operators?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"platformstrategy\">Platform Strategy</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Is Euler primarily an infrastructure play or a direct lending platform?</li>\n<li>Without a MetaMorpho equivalent, what's Euler's path to attracting lending operators?</li>\n<li>How critical is the missing \"pool manager\" abstraction for operator adoption?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"growthtradeoffs\">Growth Trade-offs</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>How will Euler's complex feature set influence market dynamics between Core and Edge segments?</li>\n<li>How does the mechanism balance the trade-off between maximizing auction efficiency and ensuring timely fee conversion?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nThe DeFi lending landscape is evolving toward market specialization rather than winner-take-all outcomes. While Euler targets sophisticated users with its comprehensive toolkit, success will ultimately hinge on ecosystem development and market-specific optimization. Today's technical superiority must translate into tomorrow's market adoption - a transition that remains the protocol's primary challenge.</p>\n<p>\\\nAuthor’s note: A version of this article was published <a href=\"https://research.2077.xyz/bringing-permissionless-lending-making-sense-of-euler\">here</a>.</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Efficient Lot Parsing with Vamstar’s Rule-Based System","url":"https://hackernoon.com/efficient-lot-parsing-with-vamstars-rule-based-system?source=rss","date":1735142411,"author":"Text Mining","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<h2 id=\"tableoflinks\">Table of Links</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/Atw2lXsJWRm7osebJVC4\">Abstract and Introduction</a></strong> </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Domain and Task</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hackernoon.com/preview/gvqItA7L7XcwOscgpVRv\">2.1.

Lot parsing</h2>\n<p>The goal of this component is to take the sentences (including those converted from table rows) classified as containing lot references/items (positive sentences), and parse them to create a structured representation of the lots/items such as that shown in Figure 6. There are two tasks in this process: 1) determining the boundaries of lots and the lot references, as the previous steps only classifies a sentence/table row as if it contains lot information; 2) from a positive sentence, extracts the structured item information including: name of the item, form, and measurement.</p>\n<p>\\\nFor 1), we use simple rules as follows:</p>\n<p>\\\n● Apply the pattern to match the start of a sentence ‘lot [token]+ [num]’, where [token] is an optional word (e.g., ‘number’, ‘no.’) and [num] is a number-like token. If a positive sentence matches this pattern, it is considered to contain a lot reference and the [num] value will be extracted as the reference; </p>\n<p>\\\n● Each sentence the above rule marks the boundary of a lot; </p>\n<p>\\\n● Positive sentences including/following an identified lot reference are considered to be associated with that lot and are subject to the second part of processing.</p>\n<p>\\\nAs examples, in Figure 2, we expect rows 2 and 3 to be considered as part of a single lot with a reference indicated in column 1, and each row to describe a separate item. In Figure 6, we expect each bullet point in Section 2.1 to be classified as a relevant lot item, with the lot reference extracted as ‘Lot 1’ for the first and the remaining text for further parsing. In Figure 7, we expect the rows in the first and second boxes to be classified as relevant, while the first row identifies the reference and the second describes the item.</p>\n<p>\\\nFor 2), in theory, one can build an NER tool given sufficient training data. However, creating training data at token level is very time-consuming and deemed infeasible by Vamstar. Instead, Vamstar built an in-house rule-based tagger that uses a combination of regular expressions and dictionary lookup. Details of this part of the system is proprietary information and cannot be included in this article. However, we explain the main principles below.</p>\n<p>\\\nFirst, using all values extracted from the ‘lot and item descriptions’ field of the TED database mentioned before, n-grams are extracted and their frequencies are generated. Domain experts were then involved in manually inspecting the derived ranked list of n-grams, to determine a ‘threshold’ (practically, different thresholds were derived for different ‘n’s) above which n-grams were deemed to be more reliable and retained as a lookup dictionary - to be called the ‘lot and item n-gram dictionary’. Second, this dictionary and together with the ‘form’ and the ‘measurement unit’ dictionaries mentioned before are used to match texts within a sentence. Finally, once the matching is completed, post-processing rules will be applied to address overlapping boundaries, or extract other values such as quantities. For example, given ‘Atropine Sulfate Solution for Injection 3 mg/10 ml Pre-filled Syringe’, the ‘matching’ phase may identify ‘atropine sulfate’ and ‘sulfate solution’ as candidate n-grams, ‘mg’ and ‘ml’ as measurement, and ‘syringe’ as form. The post-processing will merge ‘atropine sulfate’ and ‘sulfate solution’, and process a context window of the identified measurement units to extract quantities.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Authors:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) Ziqi Zhang*, Information School, the University of Sheffield, Regent Court, Sheffield, UKS1 4DP (Ziqi.Zhang@sheffield.ac.uk);</p>\n<p>(2) Tomas Jasaitis, Vamstar Ltd., London (Tomas.Jasaitis@vamstar.io);</p>\n<p>(3) Richard Freeman, Vamstar Ltd., London (Richard.Freeman@vamstar.io);</p>\n<p>(4) Rowida Alfrjani, Information School, the University of Sheffield, Regent Court, Sheffield, UKS1 4DP (Rowida.Alfrjani@sheffield.ac.uk);</p>\n<p>(5) Adam Funk, Information School, the University of Sheffield, Regent Court, Sheffield, UKS1 4DP (Adam.Funk@sheffield.ac.uk).</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<hr />\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03458\">available on arxiv</a></strong> under CC BY 4.0 license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"AMD’s CES 2025 press conference: How to watch","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/25/amds-ces-2025-press-conference-how-to-watch/","date":1735142400,"author":"Brian Heater","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<p>AMD has its work cut out for it at CES 2025.

From a report: The fiscal 2025 National Defense Authorization Act outlines Pentagon policy and military budget priorities for the year and also includes non-defense measures added as Congress wrapped up its work in December. The $895 billion spending blueprint passed the Senate and House with broad bipartisan support. \n\nThe $3 billion would go to a Federal Communications Commission program, commonly called \"rip and replace,\" to get rid of Chinese networking equipment due to national security concerns. The effort was created in 2020 to junk equipment made by telecom giant Huawei. It had an initial investment of $1.9 billion, roughly $3 billion shy of what experts said was needed to cauterize the potential vulnerability. \n\nCalls to replenish the fund have increased recently in the wake of two hacking campaigns by China, dubbed Volt Typhoon and Salt Typhoon, that saw hackers insert malicious code in U.S. infrastructure and break into at least eight telecom firms. The bill also includes a watered down requirement for the Defense Department to tap an independent third-party to study the feasibility of creating a U.S. Cyber Force, along with an \"evaluation of alternative organizational models for the cyber forces\" of the military branches.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=FCC+'Rip+and+Replace'+Provision+For+Chinese+Tech+Tops+Cyber+Provisions+in+Defense+Bill%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F25%2F157235%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F25%2F157235%2Ffcc-rip-and-replace-provision-for-chinese-tech-tops-cyber-provisions-in-defense-bill%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/12/25/157235/fcc-rip-and-replace-provision-for-chinese-tech-tops-cyber-provisions-in-defense-bill?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23561037&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Coming to Theaters: An AI-Generated Bollywood Movie","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-movie","date":1735138802,"author":"Edd Gent","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<p>Makers of the first AI feature film confront the tech's continuity problems </p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTM4NzA3OC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczOTI1NDUzM30.oEbWKHcVDoAf8I3nOLlO-wddngh7Y8StCUTeeIJi14U/image.png?width=600","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"systemd Highlights For 2024 From Run0 To Varlink To Advancing systemd-homed","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/systemd-2024-highlights","date":1735138002,"author":"Michael Larabel","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Systemd had another busy year working on many new features from run0 as a sudo alternative to making systemd-homed more robust, increasing Varlink use, systemd-boot continuing to gain more traction, and more...","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"The Top 8 Consumer Electronics Stories of 2024","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-consumer-electronics-2024","date":1735135202,"author":"Matthew S.

From a report: It might not seem that way compared with the broader world of U.S. higher education. Ivy League institutions and a handful in a similar orbit like Stanford, Duke and the University of Chicago aren't just blessed to have international cachet and their pick of excellent students and professors -- they also have the most money and the richest alumni. By contrast, public and especially smaller private colleges and universities are cutting staff and programs. Many are closing outright. \n\nA school like Harvard, now well into its fourth century, will almost certainly survive for a fifth one. But there are financial problems below the surface that could emerge if the bull market stumbles and especially if some proposed Trump administration policies are enacted. Harvard's $53.2 billion endowment is so huge that the difference between a good and a so-so investment performance translates to sums that would dwarf most colleges' entire nest eggs. \n\nFormer Harvard President and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers estimated this year that if Harvard had been able to just keep up with other Ivies and \"large endowment schools\" in the past several years, it would have $20 billion more. For perspective, he says that just $1 billion could fund 100 professorships or permanently cover tuition for 100 students. But even Harvard's peer group isn't doing as well as it could. Veteran investment consultant Richard Ennis wrote this month that high costs and \"outdated perceptions of superiority\" have stymied Ivy League endowment returns, which could have been worth 20% more since the 2008 financial crisis if invested in a classic stock and bond mix.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Elite+Colleges+Have+a+Looming+Money+Problem%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F25%2F1330200%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F25%2F1330200%2Felite-colleges-have-a-looming-money-problem%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/12/25/1330200/elite-colleges-have-a-looming-money-problem?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23560995&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Home for the holidays?

Like many remote workers, Thorpe, the nonprofit's principal engineer, works out in the middle of the day and often stays at his computer late into the night. But outside Thorpe's window, there's a soaring chain-link fence topped with coiled barbed wire. And at noon and 4 p.m. every day, a prison guard peers into his room to make sure he's where he's supposed to be at the Mountain View Correctional Facility in Charleston, Maine, where he's serving his 12th year for two drug-related convictions in New Hampshire, including intent to distribute synthetic opioids.\n \nRemote work has spread far and wide since the pandemic spurred a work-from-home revolution of sorts, but perhaps no place more unexpectedly than behind prison walls. Thorpe is one of more than 40 people incarcerated in Maine's state prison system who have landed internships and jobs with outside companies over the past two years -- some of whom work full time from their cells and earn more than the correctional officers who guard them. A handful of other states have also started allowing remote work in recent years, but none have gone as far as Maine, according to the Alliance for Higher Education in Prison, the nonprofit leading the effort.\n \nUnlike incarcerated residents with jobs in the kitchen or woodshop who earn just a few hundred dollars a month, remote workers make fair-market wages, allowing them to pay victim restitution fees and legal costs, provide child support, and contribute to Social Security and other retirement funds. Like inmates in work-release programs who have jobs out in the community, 10 percent of remote workers' wages go to the state to offset the cost of room and board. All Maine DOC residents get re-entry support for housing and job searches before they're released, and remote workers leave with even more: up-to-date resumes, a nest egg -- and the hope that they're less likely to need food or housing assistance, or resort to crime to get by.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=In+Maine%2C+Remote+Work+Gives+Prisoners+a+Lifeline%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F24%2F2226248%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F24%2F2226248%2Fin-maine-remote-work-gives-prisoners-a-lifeline%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://yro.slashdot.org/story/24/12/24/2226248/in-maine-remote-work-gives-prisoners-a-lifeline?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23560651&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Intel Mesa Code Lands Big Patch Series For Treating Convergent Values As SIMD8","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Intel-Mesa-Conv-SIMD8","date":1735127166,"author":"Michael Larabel","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"A patch series six months in the making and consisting of 24 patches by longtime Intel Linux graphics engineer Ian Romanick was merged on Christmas Eve for Mesa 25.0...","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Ruby 3.4 Programming Language Brings \"it\", Better Performance For YJIT","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Ruby-3.4-Released","date":1735124990,"author":"Michael Larabel","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Ruby 3.4 is out today as yet another annual major feature release for this programming language known for its major updates on Christmas Day...","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Critics, Not Fans, Perpetuate the Failed Second Album Myth, Study Shows","url":"https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/24/12/24/2219245/critics-not-fans-perpetuate-the-failed-second-album-myth-study-shows?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1735120800,"author":"BeauHD","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"A new study reveals that the widely accepted \"sophomore slump\" phenomenon -- where a band's second album is perceived as significantly worse than the first -- exists primarily in professional critics' reviews, not fan ratings. Researchers suggest this bias stems from social conformity among critics, while fans provide more consistent and reliable evaluations across albums. \"If every music critic has heard of a sophomore slump and everyone knows it happens, they might be convinced to over-apply it in their reviews,\" said Gregory Webster, Ph.D., the R. David Thomas Endowed Professor of Psychology at the University of Florida and co-author of the new study. \"We suspect it's a kind of social conformity, which we see in a lot of social groups.\" Phys.Org reports: Webster and his co-author, University of Hannover Professor of Educational Science Lysann Zander, Ph.D., analyzed thousands of albums rated by professional critics and amateur fans. Both critics and fans said that bands' albums generally got worse over time.\n \nBut critics were exceptionally harsh with the second album, which was an outlier in this downward trajectory. \"It's only critics that show substantial evidence of a sophomore slump bias, whereby they are giving artists' second albums unusually low reviews compared to their first and third albums,\" Webster said. \"Fans show no evidence of a sophomore slump bias.\"\n \nWebster and Zander expected that fan ratings would reflect a broader consensus about a band's true performance. Fans aren't pressured by the same social norms as professional critics. And with ratings from thousands of fans, the researchers could average across a large group to find more reliable ratings.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Critics%2C+Not+Fans%2C+Perpetuate+the+Failed+Second+Album+Myth%2C+Study+Shows%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fentertainment.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F24%2F2219245%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fentertainment.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F24%2F2219245%2Fcritics-not-fans-perpetuate-the-failed-second-album-myth-study-shows%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/24/12/24/2219245/critics-not-fans-perpetuate-the-failed-second-album-myth-study-shows?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23560647&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"New Intel Mesa Driver Patches Implement AV1 Decode For Vulkan Video","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Intel-ANV-Vulkan-Video-AV1-Dec","date":1735120800,"author":"Michael Larabel","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"While there has been Vulkan Video support within Intel's open-source \"ANV\" driver since early 2023 and extended over time to handle H.265/HEVC decode, H.264 and H.265 encode, and more, the AV1 decode support has lagged behind until now...","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"CachyOS Had A Really Great Year Advancing This Performance-Optimized Arch Linux Platform","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/CachyOS-2024-Highlights","date":1735113600,"author":"Michael Larabel","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"The CachyOS Linux distribution has really been on fire this year delivering impressive new features and performance optimizations for this Arch Linux derived OS...","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"NASA's Parker Solar Probe Completes Historic Christmas Eve Flyby of the Sun","url":"https://science.slashdot.org/story/24/12/24/2211202/nasas-parker-solar-probe-completes-historic-christmas-eve-flyby-of-the-sun?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1735110000,"author":"BeauHD","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"NASA's Parker Solar Probe made a historic approach on Christmas Eve, flying within 3.8 million miles of the Sun at a record-breaking speed of 430,000 mph. It marks humanity's closest encounter with a star. Live Science reports: Mission control cannot communicate with the probe during this rendezvous due to its vicinity to the sun, and will only know how the spacecraft fared in the early hours of Dec. 27 after a beacon signal confirms both the flyby's success and the overall state of the spacecraft. Images gathered during the flyby will beam home in early January, followed by scientific data later in the month when the probe swoops further away from the sun, Nour Rawafi, who is the project scientist for the mission, told reporters at the Annual Meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) earlier this month.\n \nParker launched in 2018 to help decode some of the biggest mysteries about our sun, such as why its outermost layer, the corona, heats up as it moves further from the sun's surface, and what processes accelerate charged particles to near-light speeds. In addition to revolutionizing our understanding about the sun, the probe also caught rare closeups of passing comets and studied the surface of Venus. On Christmas Eve, scientists expect the probe to have flown through plumes of plasma still attached to the sun, and hope it observed solar flares occurring simultaneously due to ramped-up turbulence on the sun's surface, which spark breathtaking auroras on Earth but also disrupt communication systems and other technology. \"Right now, Parker Solar Probe has achieved what we designed the mission for,\" Nicola Fox, the associate administrator for NASA Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., said in a NASA video released on Dec. 24. \"It's just a total 'Yay!

New Scientist reports: Andreas Grasskamp at the Fraunhofer Institute for Process Engineering and Packaging IVV in Germany and his colleagues trained an AI molecular odor prediction algorithm called OWSum on descriptions of different whiskies. Then, in a study involving 16 samples -- nine types of Scotch whisky and seven types of American bourbon or whiskey -- they tasked OWSum with telling drinks from the two nations apart based on keyword descriptions of their flavors, such as flowery, fruity, woody or smoky. Using these alone, the AI could tell which country a drink came from with almost 94 per cent accuracy.\n \nBecause the complex aroma of these spirits is determined by the absence or presence of many chemical compounds, the researchers also fed the AI a reference dataset of 390 molecules commonly found in whiskies. When they gave the AI data from gas chromatography -- mass spectrometry showing which molecules were present in the sample spirits, it boosted OWSum's ability to differentiate American from Scotch drams to 100 percent. Compounds such as menthol and citronellol were a dead giveaway for American whiskey, while the presence of methyl decanoate and heptanoic acid pointed to Scotch.\n \nThe researchers also tested both OWSum and a neural network on their ability to predict the top five odor keywords based on the chemical contents of a whisky. On a score from 1 for perfect accuracy to 0 for consistent inaccuracy, OWSum achieved 0.72. The neural network achieved 0.78 and human whisky expert test participants achieved only 0.57. The study has been published in the journal Nature Communications Chemistry.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=AI+Beats+Human+Experts+At+Distinguishing+American+Whiskey+From+Scotch%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F24%2F2054235%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F24%2F2054235%2Fai-beats-human-experts-at-distinguishing-american-whiskey-from-scotch%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://slashdot.org/story/24/12/24/2054235/ai-beats-human-experts-at-distinguishing-american-whiskey-from-scotch?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23560599&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Rust Drama, Russian Kernel Maintainers & Other Top Linux Kernel Happenings Of 2024","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Top-Linux-Kernel-News-2024","date":1735074724,"author":"Michael Larabel","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"With 2024 drawing quickly toward a close, here is a look back at the most popular Linux kernel news of the year ranging from exciting performance optimizations and new features such as QR code error messages over to kernel drama around Russian kernel developers, Bcachefs disturbances, and the contentious growing Rust programming language use within the kernel...","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"A comprehensive list of 2024 tech layoffs","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/24/tech-layoffs-2024-list/","date":1735072200,"author":"Cody Corrall, Alyssa Stringer","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<p>A complete list of all the known layoffs in tech, from Big Tech to startups, broken down by month throughout 2024.</p>\n<p>© 2024 TechCrunch.
