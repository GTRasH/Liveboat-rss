The Israeli military said its forces killed Khamenei. The Iranian government confirmed the supreme leader's death and announced 40 days of mourning.</p><p>During his 36-year rule, Khamenei was unwavering in his steadfast antipathy to the U.S. and Israel and to any efforts to reform and bring Iran into the 21st century.</p><p>Khamenei was born in July 1939 into a religious family in the Shia Muslim holy city of Mashhad in northeastern Iran and attended theological school. An outspoken opponent of the U.S.-backed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Khamenei was arrested several times.</p><p>He was surrounded by other Iranian activists, including Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who became Iran's first supreme leader following the country's Islamic Revolution in the late 1970s.</p><p>Khamenei survived an assassination attempt in 1981 that cost him the use of his right arm. He served as Iran's president before succeeding Khomeini as supreme leader in 1989.</p><p>Alex Vatanka, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington, D.C., says Khamenei was an unlikely candidate. Then a midlevel cleric, Khamenei lacked religious credentials, which left him feeling vulnerable, Vatanka says.</p><p>\"He knew himself.

Iran's economy was crumbling, due in large part to stringent Western sanctions, fueling more unrest.</p><p>In 2013, Khamenei agreed to secret negotiations with the U.S. about Iran's nuclear program, which eventually led to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear agreement. Vaez says Khamenei deeply distrusted the U.S. and was skeptical about the deal.</p><p>\"His argument has always been that the U.S. is always looking for pretexts, for putting pressure on Iran,\" he says. \"And if Iran concedes on the nuclear issue, then the U.S. would put pressure on Iran because of its missiles program or because of human rights violations or because of its regional policies.\"</p><p>President Trump's withdrawal from the nuclear deal during his first term in office gave some credence to Khamenei's cynicism. Analysts say Iran increased its nuclear enrichment after that to a point where it was close to being able to build a bomb.</p><p>In early 2025, when Trump reached out to Iran about a new deal, Khamenei dragged out negotiations until they began in mid-April.</p><p>But time ran out. In June,Israel made good on its threat to neutralize Iran's nuclear program, launching strikes on key facilities and killing scientists and generals. Iran retaliated, and the two sides exchanged several days of missile strikes.</p><p>On June 21, 2025, the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/21/nx-s1-5441127/iran-us-strike-nuclear-trump\" target=\"_blank\">launched major airstrikes</a> on three of Iran's nuclear enrichment sites. Trump said the facilities had been \"completely and totally obliterated,\" although there was debate among the White House and nuclear experts as to how serious Iran's nuclear program had been set back.</p><p>Vakil, of Chatham House, says Khamenei underestimated what Israel and the U.S. would do.</p><p>\"I think that Khamenei always assumed that he could play for time, and what he really didn't understand is that the world around Iran had very much changed,\" she says. \"The world had tired of Khamenei and Iranian foot-dragging and antics …&nbsp;and so that was a miscalculation.\"</p><p>But it was Iran's use of proxy militias across the region that eventually led to Khamenei's downfall. </p><p>When Hamas — the Palestinian Islamist group backed by Iran — attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing nearly 1,200 people and kidnapping 251 others, it triggered a cascade of events that ultimately led to Israel's attack on Iran.&nbsp;</p><p>The day after the 2023 Hamas-led attack, Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon started firing rockets into Israel, triggering a conflict that led to the Shia militia's top brass being decimated — including top leader <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25302/who-was-hassan-nasrallah-the-hezbollah-leader-killed-by-israel\" target=\"_blank\">Hassan Nasrallah</a>.</p><p>Israel and Iran traded direct airstrikes for the first time in 2024 as part of that conflict.</p><p>Israel's bombing of Iranian weapons shipments in Syria also helped weaken the regime of Syria's then-dictator, Bashar al-Assad, an important ally of Iran.

Neoliberal capitalism has hollowed out democratic institutions and concentrated power in a transnational “authoritarian international” of billionaires, security chiefs, and political fixers who monetize state power while shielding one another from accountability. At the same time, Big Tech platforms have become neo‑feudal estates that extract rent from our data and behavior, weaponize disinformation, and provide the surveillance backbone of an emerging global police state.</p><p>Drawing on the work of Robert Reich, William I. Robinson, Yanis Varoufakis, and others, alongside historian Heather Cox Richardson’s detailed account of Trump‑era patronage, whistleblower suppression, and DHS/ICE mega‑detention plans, the essay contends that America is rapidly constructing a system of concentration‑camp infrastructure and paramilitary policing designed to manage “surplus” populations and political dissent. Elite impunity, entrenched through national‑security exceptionalism, legal immunities, and revolving‑door careers, means that those directing lawless violence face virtually no consequences. Elections still happen, courts still sit, newspapers still publish, but substantive power is increasingly exercised by unelected oligarchs, tech lords, and security bureaucracies.</p><p>This authoritarian drift cannot be separated from the broader crisis of industrial civilization. Ecological overshoot, climate chaos, resource constraints, and structural economic stagnation have undermined the promise of endless growth on which liberal democracy once rested. Rather than using the remnants of industrial wealth to democratize a just transition, ruling elites are hardening borders, expanding carceral infrastructure, and building a security regime to contain “surplus” humanity in a world of shrinking energy and material throughput. America’s oligarchic techno‑feudal fascism is thus not an anomaly, but one plausible endgame of industrial civilization: a stratified order of gated enclaves above and camps and precarity below, designed to preserve elite power as the old industrial world comes apart.</p><p><strong>I. From liberal promise to oligarchic capture</strong></p><p>The American republic was founded on a promise that power would be divided, constrained, and answerable: a written constitution, separated branches, periodic elections, and a Bill of Rights that set bright lines even the sovereign could not cross. That promise was always compromised by slavery, settler colonialism, and gendered exclusion, but it retained real, if uneven, force as a normative horizon. What has shifted over the past half‑century is not simply the familiar gap between creed and practice, but the underlying structure of the system itself: the center of gravity has moved from public institutions toward a private oligarchy whose wealth and leverage allow it to function as a parallel sovereign.</p><p>The neoliberal turn of the 1970s and 1980s marked the decisive inflection point. Deregulation, financial liberalization, the crushing of organized labor, and the privatization of public goods redistributed power and income upward on a historic scale. Trade liberalization and capital mobility allowed corporations and investors to pit governments and workers against one another, extracting subsidies and tax concessions under the permanent threat of capital flight. At the same time, Supreme Court decisions eroded limits on political spending, redefining “speech” as something that could be purchased in unlimited quantities by those with the means.</p><p>The result, as Robert Reich notes, has been the consolidation of an American oligarchy that “paved the road to fascism” by ensuring that public policy reflects donor preferences far more consistently than popular majorities. In issue after issue, such as taxation, labor law, healthcare, and environmental regulation, there is a clear skew: the wealthy get what they want more often than not, while broadly popular but redistributive policies routinely die in committee or are gutted beyond recognition. This is not a conspiracy in the melodramatic sense; it is how the wiring of the system now works.</p><p>William Robinson’s analysis of “twenty‑first‑century fascism” sharpens the point. Global capitalism in its current form generates chronic crises: overproduction, under‑consumption, ecological breakdown, and a growing population that capital cannot profitably employ. Under such conditions, democratic politics becomes dangerous for elites, because electorates might choose structural reforms such as wealth taxes, public ownership, strong unions, and Green New Deal‑style transitions that would curb profits. Faced with this prospect, segments of transnational capital begin to see authoritarian solutions as rational: better to hollow out democracy, harden borders, and construct a global police state than to accept serious redistribution.</p><p>American politics in the early twenty‑first century fits this pattern with unsettling precision. A decaying infrastructure, stagnant wages, ballooning personal debt, militarized policing, and permanent war have produced widespread disillusionment. As faith in institutions erodes, public life is flooded with resentment and nihilism that can be redirected against scapegoats (immigrants, racial minorities, feminists, and queer and trans people) rather than against the oligarchic‑power‑complex that profits from the decay. It is in this vacuum that a figure like Donald Trump thrives: a billionaire demagogue able to channel anger away from the class that actually governs and toward those even more marginalized.</p><p>The decisive shift from plutocratic dysfunction to fascist danger occurs when oligarchs cease to see constitutional democracy as even instrumentally useful and instead invest in movements openly committed to minority rule. Koch‑style networks, Mercer‑funded operations, and Silicon Valley donors willing to underwrite hard‑right projects are not supporting democracy‑enhancing reforms; they are building the infrastructure for authoritarianism, from voter suppression to ideological media to data‑driven propaganda. The system that emerges is hybrid: elections still occur, courts still sit, newspapers still publish, but substantive power is increasingly concentrated in unelected hands.</p><p><strong>II. The “authoritarian international” and the shadow world of deals</strong></p><p>Historian Heather Cox Richardson’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajZudGu4exA\">recent analysis</a> captures a formation that much mainstream commentary still struggles to name: a transnational <strong>“authoritarian international”</strong> in which oligarchs, political operatives, royal families, security chiefs, and organized criminals cooperate to monetize state power while protecting one another from scrutiny. This is not a formal alliance; it is an overlapping ecology of relationships, exclusive vacations, investment vehicles, shell companies, foundations, and intelligence ties, through which information, favors, and money flow.</p><p>The key is that this network is structurally post‑ideological. As Robert Mueller warned in his 2011 description of an emerging “iron triangle” of politicians, businesspeople, and criminals, these actors are not primarily concerned with religion, nationality, or traditional ideology. They will work across confessional and national lines so long as the deals are lucrative and risk is manageably socialized onto others. Saudi royals invest alongside Western hedge funds; Russian oligarchs launder money through London property and American private equity; Israeli and Emirati firms collaborate with U.S. tech companies on surveillance products that are then sold worldwide.</p><p>Within this milieu, the formal distinction between public office and private interest blurs. Richardson’s analysis of Donald Trump’s abrupt reversal on the Gordie Howe International Bridge after a complaint by a billionaire competitor with ties to Jeffrey Epstein—reads less like the exercise of public policy judgment and more like feudal patronage: the sovereign intervenes to protect a favored lord’s toll road. Tiny shifts in regulatory posture or federal support can move billions of dollars; for those accustomed to having the president’s ear, such interventions are simply part of doing business.</p><p>The same logic governs foreign policy. The Trump‑Kushner axis exemplifies this fusion of public and private. When a whistleblower alleges that the Director of National Intelligence suppressed an intercept involving foreign officials discussing Jared Kushner and sensitive topics like Iran, and when the complaint is then choked off with aggressive redaction and executive privilege, we see <strong>the machinery of secrecy misused not to protect the national interest but to shield a member of the family‑cum‑business empire at the center of power</strong>. It is as if the state has become a family office with nuclear weapons.</p><p>Josh Marshall’s phrase <strong>“authoritarian international”</strong> is apt because it names both the class composition and the political function of this network. The same names recur across far‑right projects: donors and strategists who back nationalist parties in Europe, ultras in Latin America, Modi’s BJP in India, and the MAGA movement in the United States. Their interests are not identical, but they overlap around a shared agenda: weakening labor and environmental protections, undermining independent media and courts, militarizing borders, and securing immunity for themselves and their peers.</p><p>This world is lubricated by blackmail and mutually assured destruction. As Richardson notes, players often seem to hold compromising material on one another, whether in the form of documented sexual abuse, financial crime, or war crimes. This shared vulnerability paradoxically stabilizes the network: as long as everyone has something on everyone else, defection is dangerous, and a predatory equilibrium holds. From the standpoint of democratic publics, however, this stability is catastrophic, because it means that scandal—once a mechanism for enforcing norms—loses much of its power. When “everyone is dirty,” no one can be clean enough to prosecute the others without risking exposure.</p><p><strong>III. Techno‑feudal aristocracy and the colonization of everyday life</strong></p><p>Layered atop this transnational oligarchy is the digital order that Varoufakis and others describe as techno‑feudalism: a regime in which a handful of platforms function like neo‑feudal estates, extracting rent from their “serfs” (users, gig workers, content creators) rather than competing in open markets. This shift is more than metaphor. In classical capitalism, firms profited primarily by producing goods or services and selling them on markets where competitors could, in principle, undercut them. In the platform order, gatekeepers profit by controlling access to the marketplace itself, imposing opaque terms on those who must use their infrastructure to communicate, work, or even find housing.</p><p>This can be seen across sectors:</p><ul><li><p>Social media platforms own the digital public square. They monetize attention by selling advertisers access to finely sliced demographic and psychographic segments, while their recommendation algorithms optimize for engagement, often by privileging outrage and fear.</p></li><li><p>Ride‑hailing and delivery apps control the interface between customers and labor, setting prices unilaterally and disciplining workers through ratings, algorithmic management, and the ever‑present threat of “deactivation.”</p></li><li><p>Cloud providers and app stores gatekeep access to the basic infrastructure upon which countless smaller firms depend, taking a cut of transactions and reserving the right to change terms or remove competitors from the ecosystem entirely.</p></li></ul><p>In each case, the platform is less a company among companies and more a landlord among tenants, collecting tolls for the right to exist within its domain. Users produce the very capital stock, data, content, behavioral profiles, that platforms own and monetize, yet they have little say over how this material is used or how the digital environment is structured. The asymmetry of power is profound: the lords can alter the code of the world; the serfs can, at best, adjust their behavior to avoid algorithmic invisibility or sanction.</p><p>For authoritarian politics, this structure is a gift. First, platforms have become the primary vectors of disinformation and propaganda. Cambridge Analytica’s work for Trump in 2016, funded by billionaires like the Mercers, was an early prototype: harvest data, micro‑target individuals with tailored&nbsp;messaging, and flood their feeds with narratives designed to activate fear and resentment. Since then, the techniques have grown more sophisticated, and far‑right movements worldwide have learned to weaponize meme culture, conspiracy theories, and “shitposting” as recruitment tools.</p><p>Second, the same infrastructures that enable targeted advertising enable granular surveillance. Location data, social graphs, search histories, and facial‑recognition databases provide an unprecedented toolkit for monitoring and disciplining populations. In the hands of a regime sliding toward fascism, these tools can be turned against dissidents with terrifying efficiency: geofencing protests to identify attendees, scraping social media to build dossiers, using AI to flag “pre‑criminal” behavior. The emerging “global police state” that Robinson describes depends heavily on such techno‑feudal capacities.</p><p>Third, the digital order corrodes the very preconditions for democratic deliberation. Information overload, filter bubbles, and algorithmic amplification of sensational content produce a public sphere saturated with noise. Under these conditions, truth becomes just another aesthetic, and the distinction between fact and fiction collapses into vibes. This is the post‑modern nihilism you name: a sense that nothing is stable enough to believe in, that everything is spin. Fascist movements do not seek to resolve this condition; they weaponize it, insisting that only the Leader and his trusted media tell the real truth, while everything else is a hostile lie.</p><p>Finally, the techno‑feudal aristocracy’s material interests align with authoritarianism. Privacy regulations, antitrust enforcement, data localization rules, and strong labor rights all threaten platform profits. Democratic movements that demand such reforms are therefore adversaries. Conversely, strongman leaders who promise deregulation, tax breaks, and law‑and‑order crackdowns, even if they occasionally threaten specific firms, are often acceptable partners. The result is a convergence: oligarchs of data and oligarchs of oil, real estate, and finance finding common cause in an order that disciplines the many and exempts the few.</p><p><strong>IV. Elite impunity and the machinery of lawlessness</strong></p><p>Authoritarianism is not only about who holds power; it is about who is answerable for wrongdoing. A system where elites can violate laws with impunity while ordinary people are punished harshly for minor infractions is already halfway to fascism, whatever labels it wears. The United States has, over recent decades, constructed precisely such a system.</p><p>The Arab Center’s “Machinery of Impunity” report details how, in areas ranging from mass surveillance to foreign wars to domestic policing, senior officials who authorize illegal acts almost never face criminal consequences. Edward Snowden’s revelations exposed systemic violations of privacy and civil liberties, yet it was the whistleblower who faced prosecution and exile, not the architects of the programs. Torture during the “war on terror” was acknowledged, even documented in official reports, but those who designed and approved the torture regime kept their law licenses, academic posts, and media gigs. Lethal strikes on small boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, justified by secret intelligence and shielded by classified legal opinions, have killed dozens with no public evidence that the targets posed imminent threats.</p><p>This pattern is not an aberration but a feature. As a Penn State law review article <a href=\"https://insight.dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1144&amp;context=jlia\">notes</a>, the U.S. legal system builds in multiple layers of protection for high officials: sovereign immunity, state secrets privilege, narrow standing rules, and prosecutorial discretion all combine to make it extraordinarily difficult to hold the powerful to account. Violations of the Hatch Act, campaign‑finance laws, or ethics rules are often treated as technicalities, and when reports do document unlawful behavior, as in the case of Mike Pompeo’s partisan abuse of his diplomatic office, there are “no consequences” beyond mild censure. Jamelle Bouie’s recent video essay for the New York Times drives the point home: America is “bad at accountability” because institutions have been designed and interpreted to favor elite impunity.</p><p>Richardson shows how this culture functions inside the national‑security state. A whistleblower complaint alleging that the Director of National Intelligence suppressed an intelligence intercept involving Jared Kushner and foreign officials was not allowed to run its course. Instead, it was bottled up, then transmitted to congressional overseers in a highly redacted form, with executive privilege invoked to shield the president’s involvement. The same mechanisms that insulate covert operations abroad from democratic oversight are deployed to protect domestic political allies from scrutiny.</p><p>Immigration enforcement offers another window. The Arab Center notes that ICE raids, family separation, and other abuses “escalated under the current Trump administration into highly visible kidnappings, abuse, and deportations” with little accountability for senior officials. The National Immigrant Justice Center documents a detention system where 90 percent of detainees are held in for‑profit facilities, where medical neglect, punitive solitary confinement, and preventable deaths are common, yet contracts are renewed and expanded. A culture of impunity allows agents and managers to treat rights violations not as career‑ending scandals but as acceptable collateral damage.</p><p>Latin American scholars of impunity warn that such selective enforcement produces a “quiet crisis of accountability” in which the rule of law is hollowed out from within. Laws remain on the books, but their application is skewed: harsh on the poor and marginalized, permissive toward the powerful. Over time, this normalizes the idea that some people are above the law, while others exist primarily as objects of control. When a polity internalizes this hierarchy, fascism no longer needs to arrive in jackboots; it is already present in the daily operations of the justice system.</p><p>The danger, as the Arab Center emphasizes, is that the costs of impunity “come home to roost.” Powers originally justified as necessary to fight terrorism or foreign enemies migrate back into domestic politics. Surveillance tools built for foreign intelligence monitoring are turned on activists and journalists; militarized police tactics perfected in occupied territories are imported into American streets. A population taught to accept lawless violence against outsiders (migrants, foreigners, enemy populations) is gradually conditioned to accept similar violence against internal opponents.</p><p><strong>V. Concentration camps, paramilitary policing, and ritualized predatory violence</strong></p><p>In this context of oligarchic capture, techno‑feudal control, and elite impunity, the rapid expansion of detention infrastructure and the deployment of paramilitary “federal agents” across the interior United States are not aberrations; they are central pillars of an emergent fascist order.</p><p>Richardson’s insistence on calling these facilities concentration camps is analytically exact. A concentration camp, in the historical sense, is not necessarily a death camp; it is a place where a state concentrates populations it considers threats or burdens, subjecting them to confinement, disease, abuse, and often death through neglect rather than industrialized extermination. By that definition, the sprawling network of ICE and Border Patrol detention centers, where people are warehoused for months to years, often in horrific conditions, qualifies.</p><p>New reporting details how this system is poised to scale up dramatically. An internal ICE memo, recently surfaced, outlines a $38 billion plan for a “new detention center model” that would, in one year, create capacity for roughly 92,600 people by purchasing eight “mega centers,” 16 processing centers, and 10 additional facilities. The largest of these warehouses would hold between 7,000 and 10,000 people each for average stays of about 60 days, more than double the size of the largest current federal prison. Separate reporting has mapped at least 23 industrial warehouses being surveyed for conversion into mass detention camps, with leases already secured at several sites.</p><p>Investigations by Amnesty International and others into prototype facilities have found detainees shackled in overcrowded cages, underfed, forced to use open‑air toilets that flood, and routinely denied medical care. Sexual assault and extortion by guards, negligent deaths, and at least one homicide have been documented. These are not accidents; they are predictable outcomes of a profit‑driven system where private contractors are paid per bed and oversight is weak, and of a political culture that dehumanizes migrants as “invaders” or “animals.”</p><p>Richardson highlights another crucial dimension: the way DHS has been retooled to project this violence into the interior as a form of political terror. Agents from ICE and Border Patrol, subdivisions of a relatively new department lacking the institutional restraints of the military, have been deployed in cities far from any border, often in unmarked vehicles, wearing masks and lacking visible identification. Secret legal memos under Trump gutted the traditional requirement of a judicial warrant for entering homes, replacing it with internal sign‑off by another DHS official, a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment’s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.</p><p>This matters both instrumentally and symbolically. Instrumentally, it enables efficient mass raids and “snatch and grab” operations that bypass local law‑enforcement norms and judicial oversight. Symbolically, it communicates that the state reserves the right to operate as a lawless force, unconstrained by the very constitution it claims to defend. When masked, unidentified agents can seize people off the streets, shove them into unmarked vans, and deposit them in processing centers without due process, the aesthetic of fascism…thugs in the night…becomes reality.</p><p>Richardson rightly connects this to the post‑Reconstruction South, where paramilitary groups like the Ku Klux Klan, often tolerated or quietly aided by local officials, used terror to destroy a biracial democracy that had briefly flourished. Today’s difference is that communications technology allows rapid mobilization of witnesses and counter‑protesters: people can rush to the scene when agents arrive, document abuses on smartphones, and coordinate legal support. Yet even this can be folded into the logic of spectacle. The images of militarized agents confronting crowds under the glow of streetlights and police floodlamps serve as warnings: this is what happens when you resist.</p><p>The planned network of processing centers and mega‑warehouses adds another layer of menace. As Richardson points out, if the stated goal is deportation, there is no clear need for facilities capable of imprisoning tens of thousands for months. Part of the answer is coercive leverage: detained people are easier to pressure into abandoning asylum claims and accepting removal, especially when they are told, day after day, that they could walk free if they “just sign.” But the architecture also anticipates a future in which new categories of internal enemies, protesters, “Antifa,” “domestic extremists,” can be funneled into the same carceral estate once migrant flows diminish or political needs change.</p><p>Economically, the camps generate their own constituency. ICE and DHS tout job creation numbers to local officials, promising hundreds of stable, often union‑free positions in communities hollowed out by deindustrialization. Private prison firms and construction companies see lucrative contracts; investors see secure returns backed by federal guarantees. A web of stakeholders thus becomes materially invested in the continuation and expansion of mass detention. <strong>This is techno‑feudalism in concrete and razor wire: a carceral estate in which bodies are the rent‑producing asset.</strong></p><p>Once such an estate exists, its logic tends to spread. Border‑style tactics migrate into ordinary policing; surveillance tools trialed on migrants are turned on domestic movements; legal doctrines crafted to justify raids and warrantless searches in the name of immigration control seep into other domains. The fascist gradient steepens: more people find themselves at risk of sudden disappearance into a system where rights are theoretical and violence is routine.</p>","contentLength":25529,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47198912"},{"title":"The whole thing was a scam","url":"https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/the-whole-thing-was-scam","date":1772297509,"author":"guilamu","guid":214,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47197505"},{"title":"Obsidian Sync now has a headless client","url":"https://help.obsidian.md/sync/headless","date":1772296313,"author":"adilmoujahid","guid":184,"unread":true,"content":"<!DOCTYPE html>","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47197267"},{"title":"Cognitive Debt: When Velocity Exceeds Comprehension","url":"https://www.rockoder.com/beyondthecode/cognitive-debt-when-velocity-exceeds-comprehension/","date":1772293150,"author":"pagade","guid":213,"unread":true,"content":"<img src=\"https://www.rockoder.com/images/beyondthecode/cognitive-debt-hero.svg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"eager\"><p>The engineer shipped seven features in a single sprint. DORA metrics looked immaculate. The promotion packet practically wrote itself.</p><p>Six months later, an architectural change required modifying those features. No one on the team could explain why certain components existed or how they interacted. The engineer who built them stared at her own code like a stranger’s.</p><p><strong>Code has become cheaper to produce than to perceive.</strong></p><p>When an engineer writes code manually, two parallel processes occur. The first is production: characters appear in files, tests get written, systems change. The second is absorption: mental models form, edge cases become intuitive, architectural relationships solidify into understanding. These processes are coupled. The act of typing forces engagement. The friction of implementation creates space for reasoning.</p><p>AI-assisted development decouples these processes. A prompt generates hundreds of lines in seconds. The engineer reviews, adjusts, iterates. Output accelerates. But absorption cannot accelerate proportionally. The cognitive work of truly understanding what was built, why it was built that way, and how it relates to everything else remains bounded by human processing speed.</p><p><strong>This gap between output velocity and comprehension velocity is cognitive debt.</strong></p><p>Unlike technical debt, which surfaces through system failures or maintenance costs, <strong>cognitive debt remains invisible to velocity metrics</strong>. The code works. The tests pass. The features ship. The deficit exists only in the minds of the engineers who built the system, manifesting as uncertainty about their own work.</p><p>The debt is not truly invisible. It eventually appears in reliability metrics: Mean Time to Recovery stretches longer, Change Failure Rate creeps upward. But these are lagging indicators, separated by months from the velocity metrics that drive quarterly decisions. By the time MTTR signals a problem, the comprehension deficit has already compounded.</p><h2>What Organizations Actually Measure</h2><p>Engineering performance systems evolved to measure observable outputs. Story points completed. Features shipped. Commits merged. Review turnaround time. These metrics emerged from an era when output and comprehension were tightly coupled, when shipping something implied understanding something.</p><p>The metrics never measured comprehension directly because comprehension was assumed. An engineer who shipped a feature was presumed to understand that feature. <strong>The presumption held because the production process itself forced understanding.</strong></p><p><strong>That presumption no longer holds.</strong> An engineer can now ship features while maintaining only surface familiarity with their implementation. The features work. The metrics register success. The organizational knowledge that would traditionally accumulate alongside those features simply does not form at the same rate.</p><p>Performance calibration committees see velocity improvements. They do not see comprehension deficits. They cannot, because no artifact of the organizational measurement system captures that dimension.</p><p>The discussion of cognitive debt typically focuses on the engineer who generates code. The more acute problem sits with the engineer who reviews it.</p><p>Code review evolved as a quality gate. A senior engineer examines a junior engineer’s work, catching errors, suggesting improvements, transferring knowledge. The rate-limiting factor was always the junior engineer’s output speed. Senior engineers could review faster than juniors could produce.</p><p>AI-assisted development inverts this relationship. <strong>A junior engineer can now generate code faster than a senior engineer can critically audit it.</strong> The volume of generated code exceeds the bandwidth available for deep review. Something has to give, and typically it is review depth.</p><p>The reviewer faces an impossible choice. Maintain previous review standards and become a bottleneck that negates the velocity gains AI provides. Or approve code at the rate it arrives and hope the tests catch what the review missed. Most choose the latter, often unconsciously, because organizational pressure favors throughput.</p><p>This is where cognitive debt compounds fastest. The author’s comprehension deficit might be recoverable through later engagement with the code. The reviewer’s comprehension deficit propagates: they approved code they do not fully understand, which now carries implicit endorsement. <strong>The organizational assumption that reviewed code is understood code no longer holds.</strong></p><p>Engineers working extensively with AI tools report a specific form of exhaustion that differs from traditional burnout. Traditional burnout emerges from sustained cognitive load, from having too much to hold in mind while solving complex problems. The new pattern emerges from something closer to cognitive disconnection.</p><p>The work happens quickly. Progress is visible. But the engineer experiences a persistent sense of not quite grasping their own output. They can execute, but explanation requires reconstruction. They can modify, but prediction becomes unreliable. The system they built feels slightly foreign even as it functions correctly.</p><p>This creates a distinctive psychological state: <strong>high output combined with low confidence</strong>. Engineers produce more while feeling less certain about what they have produced. In organizations that stack-rank based on visible output, this creates pressure to continue generating despite the growing uncertainty.</p><p>The engineer who pauses to deeply understand what they built falls behind in velocity metrics. The engineer who prioritizes throughput over comprehension meets their quarterly objectives. <strong>The incentive structure selects for the behavior that accelerates cognitive debt accumulation.</strong></p><h2>When Organizational Memory Fails</h2><p>Knowledge in engineering organizations exists in two forms. The first is explicit: documentation, design documents, recorded decisions. The second is tacit: understanding held in the minds of people who built and maintained systems over time. Tacit knowledge cannot be fully externalized because much of it exists as intuition, pattern recognition, and contextual judgment that formed through direct engagement with the work.</p><p>When the people who built a system leave or rotate to new projects, tacit knowledge walks out with them. Organizations traditionally replenished this knowledge through the normal process of engineering work. New engineers building on existing systems developed their own tacit understanding through the friction of implementation.</p><p>AI-assisted development potentially short-circuits this replenishment mechanism. If new engineers can generate working modifications without developing deep comprehension, they never form the tacit knowledge that would traditionally accumulate. <strong>The organization loses knowledge not just through attrition but through insufficient formation.</strong></p><p>This creates a delayed failure mode. The system continues to function. New features continue to ship. But the reservoir of people who truly understand the system gradually depletes. When circumstances eventually require that understanding, when something breaks in an unexpected way or requirements change in a way that demands architectural reasoning, the organization discovers the deficit.</p><p>Three failure modes emerge as cognitive debt accumulates.</p><p>The first involves the reversal of a normally reliable heuristic. Engineers typically trust code that has been in production for years. If it survived that long, it probably works. The longer code exists without causing problems, the more confidence it earns. AI-generated code inverts this pattern. <strong>The longer it remains untouched, the more dangerous it becomes</strong>, because the context window of the humans around it has closed completely. Code that was barely understood when written becomes entirely opaque after the people who wrote it have moved on.</p><blockquote>They are debugging a black box written by a black box.</blockquote><p>The second failure mode surfaces during incidents. An alert fires at 3:00 AM. The on-call engineer opens a system they did not build, generated by tools they did not supervise, documented in ways that assume familiarity they do not possess. <strong>They are debugging a black box written by a black box.</strong> What would have been a ten-minute fix when someone understood the system becomes a four-hour forensic investigation when no one does. Multiply this across enough incidents and the aggregate cost exceeds whatever velocity gains the AI-assisted development provided.</p><blockquote>The organization is effectively trading its pipeline of future Staff Engineers for this quarter's feature delivery.</blockquote><p>The third failure mode operates on a longer timescale. Junior engineers who rely primarily on AI-assisted development never develop the intuition that comes from manual implementation. They ship features without forming the scar tissue that informs architectural judgment. The organization is effectively trading its pipeline of future Staff Engineers for this quarter’s feature delivery. The cost does not appear in current headcount models because the people who would have become senior architects five years from now are not yet absent. </p><p>From the perspective of engineering leadership, AI-assisted development presents as productivity gain. Teams ship faster. Roadmaps compress. Headcount discussions become more favorable. These are the observable signals that propagate upward through organizational reporting structures.</p><p>The cognitive debt accumulating in those teams does not present as a signal. There is no metric for “engineers who can explain their own code without re-reading it.” There is no dashboard for “organizational comprehension depth.” The concept does not fit into quarterly business review formats or headcount justification narratives.</p><p>Directors make decisions based on observable signals. When those signals uniformly indicate success, the decision to double down on the approach that produced those signals is rational within the information environment available to leadership. <strong>The decision is not wrong given the data. The data is incomplete.</strong></p><p>The cognitive debt framing does not apply uniformly across all engineering work. Some tasks genuinely are mechanical. Some codebases genuinely benefit from rapid iteration without deep architectural understanding. Some features genuinely do not require the level of comprehension that would traditionally form through manual implementation.</p><p>The model also assumes that comprehension was previously forming at adequate rates. This assumption may be generous. Engineers have always varied in how deeply they understood their own work. The distribution may simply be shifting rather than a new phenomenon emerging.</p><p>Additionally, tooling and documentation practices may evolve to partially close the comprehension gap. If organizations develop methods for capturing and transmitting the understanding that AI-assisted development fails to form organically, the debt may prove manageable rather than accumulative.</p><blockquote>The system is optimizing correctly for what it measures. What it measures no longer captures what matters.</blockquote><p>The fundamental challenge is that <strong>organizations cannot optimize for what they cannot measure</strong>. Velocity is measurable. Comprehension is not, or at least not through any mechanism that currently feeds into performance evaluation, promotion decisions, or headcount planning.</p><p>Until comprehension becomes legible to organizational decision-making systems, the incentive structure will continue to favor velocity. Engineers who prioritize understanding over output will appear less productive than peers who prioritize output over understanding. Performance calibration will reward the behavior that accumulates debt faster.</p><p>This is not a failure of individual managers or engineers. It is a measurement system designed for an era when production and comprehension were coupled, operating in an era when that coupling no longer holds. <strong>The system is optimizing correctly for what it measures. What it measures no longer captures what matters.</strong></p><p>The gap will eventually manifest. Whether through maintenance costs that exceed projections, through incidents that require understanding no one possesses, or through new requirements that expose the brittleness of systems built without deep comprehension. The timing and form of manifestation remain uncertain. The underlying dynamic does not.</p>","contentLength":12316,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47196582"},{"title":"OpenAI fires an employee for prediction market insider trading","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/openai-fires-employee-insider-trading-polymarket-kalshi/","date":1772286380,"author":"bookofjoe","guid":212,"unread":true,"content":"<p> an employee following an investigation into their activity on <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-political-war-over-prediction-markets-is-just-getting-started/\">prediction market platforms</a> including Polymarket, WIRED has learned.</p><p>OpenAI CEO of Applications, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/fidji-simo-is-openais-other-ceo-and-she-swears-shell-make-chatgpt-profitable/#intcid=_wired-verso-hp-trending_ea249350-52ab-42d0-9cfe-e91d580f41e8_popular4-2\">Fidji Simo</a>, disclosed the termination in an internal message to employees earlier this year.

OpenAI has not revealed the name of the employee or the specifics of their trades.</p><p>Evidence suggests that this was not an isolated event. Polymarket runs on the Polygon blockchain network, so its trading ledger is pseudonymous but traceable. According to an analysis by the financial data platform Unusual Whales, there have been clusters of activities, which the service flagged as suspicious, around OpenAI-themed events since March 2023.</p><p>Unusual Whales flagged 77 positions in 60 wallet addresses as suspected insider trades, looking at the age of the account, trading history, and significance of investment, among other factors. Suspicious trades hinged on the release dates of products like <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/openai-launches-sora-2-tiktok-like-app/\">Sora</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/gpt-5-coding-review-software-engineering/\">GPT-5</a>, and the ChatGPT Browser, as well as CEO Sam Altman’s employment status. In November 2023, two days after Altman was dramatically ousted from the company, a new wallet placed a significant bet that he would return, netting over $16,000 in profits. The account never placed another bet.</p><p>The behavior fits into patterns typical of insider trades. “The tell is the clustering. In the 40 hours before OpenAI launched its browser, 13 brand-new wallets with zero trading history appeared on the site for the first time to collectively bet $309,486 on the right outcome,” says Unusual Whales CEO Matt Saincome. “When you see that many fresh wallets making the same bet at the same time, it raises a real question about whether the secret is getting out.”</p><p>Prediction markets have exploded in popularity in recent years. These platforms allow customers to buy “event contracts” on the outcomes of future events ranging from the winner of the Super Bowl to the daily price of Bitcoin to whether the United States will go to war with Iran. There are a wide array of markets tied to events in the technology sector; you can trade on what Nvidia’s quarterly earnings will be, or when Tesla will launch a new car, or which AI companies will IPO in 2026.</p><p>As the platforms have grown, so have concerns that they allow traders to profit from insider knowledge. “This prediction market world makes the Wild West look tame in comparison,” says Jeff Edelstein, a senior analyst at the betting news site InGame. “If there's a market that exists where the answer is known, somebody's going to trade on it.”</p><p>Earlier this week, Kalshi <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/kalshi-insider-trading-california-politician-and-youtuber/\">announced</a> that it had reported several suspicious insider trading cases to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the government agency overseeing these markets. In one instance, an employee of the popular YouTuber Mr. Beast was suspended for two years and fined $20,000 for making trades related to the streamer’s activities; in another, the far-right political candidate Kyle Langford was banned from the platform for making a trade on his own campaign. The company also announced a number of initiatives to prevent insider trading and market manipulation.</p><p>While Kalshi has heavily promoted its crackdown on insider trading, Polymarket has stayed silent on the matter. The company did not return requests for comments.</p><p>In the past, major trades on technology-themed markets have sparked speculation that there are Big Tech employees profiting by using their insider knowledge to gain an edge.

The productivity gains are real, but there are costs that don’t show up on any dashboard.</p><p>Imagine a spectrum. On the far left are humans typing on the keyboard, seeing the code in the IDE. On the far right: AGI. It implements everything on its own. Cheaply, flawlessly, better than any human, and no human overseer is required. Somewhere between those two extremes there’s you, using AI, today. That threshold moves to the right every week as models improve, tools mature, and workflows get refined.</p><blockquote><p>Which is higher risk, using AI too much, or using AI too little?</p></blockquote><p>and it made me think about LLMs for coding differently, especially after reading what other devs share on AI adoption in different workplaces. You can be wrong in both directions, but is the desired amount of AI usage at work changing as the models improve?</p><p>Not long ago the first AI coding tools like Cursor (2023) or Copilot (2022) emerged. They were able to quickly index the codebase using RAG, so they had the local context. They had all the knowledge of the models powering them, so they had an external knowledge of the Internet as well. Googling and browsing StackOverflow wasn’t needed anymore. Cursor gave the users a custom IDE with built in AI powered autocomplete and other baked-in AI tools, like chat, to make the experience coherent.</p><p>Then came the agent promise. MCPs, autonomous workflows, <a href=\"https://michaelxbloch.substack.com/p/no-coding-before-10am\">articles about agents running overnight</a> started to pop up left and right. It was a different use of AI than Cursor. <strong>It was no longer an AI-assisted human coding, but a human-assisted AI coding.</strong></p><p>Many devs tried it and got burned. Agents made tons of small mistakes. The AI-first process required a complete paradigm shift in how devs think about coding, in order to achieve great results. Also, agents often got stuck in loops, hallucinate dependencies, and produced code that looks almost right but isn’t. You needed to learn about a completely new tech, fueled by FOMO. And this new shiny tool never got it 100% right on the first try.</p><p>Software used to be deterministic. You controlled it with if/else branches, explicit state machines, clear logic. The new reality is controlling the development process with prompts, system instructions, and CLAUDE.md files, and hope the model produces the output you expect.</p><blockquote><p>An engineer at Spotify on their morning commute from Slack on their cell phone can tell Claude to fix a bug or add a new feature to the iOS app. And once Claude finishes that work, the engineer then gets a new version of the app, pushed to them on Slack on their phone, so that he can then merge it to production, all before they even arrive at the office.”</p></blockquote><p>I hope they at least review the code before merging.</p><p>The next stage is an (almost) full automation. That’s what many execs want and try to achieve. It’s a capitalistic wet dream, a worker that never sleeps, never gets tired, always wants to work, is infinitely productive. But Geoffrey Hinton predicted in 2016 that deep learning would outperform radiologists at image analysis within five years. Anthropic’s CEO predicted AI would write 90% of code within three to six months of March 2025. None of this happened as predicted. The trajectory is real, but the timeline keeps slipping.</p><p>In 2012, neuroscientist Manfred Spitzer published <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Dementia_(book)\">Digital Dementia</a>, arguing that when we outsource mental tasks to digital devices, the brain pathways responsible for those tasks atrophy. Use it or lose it. Not all of this is proven scientifically, but neuroplasticity research shows the brain strengthens pathways that get used and weakens ones that don’t. The core principle of the book is that the cognitive skills that you stop practicing will decline.</p><p>Margaret-Anne Storey, a software engineering researcher, recently gave this a more precise name: <a href=\"https://margaretstorey.com/blog/2026/02/09/cognitive-debt/\">cognitive debt</a>. Technical debt lives in the code. Cognitive debt lives in developers’ heads. It’s the accumulated loss of understanding that happens when you build fast without comprehending what you built. She grounds it in Peter Naur’s 1985 theory that a program is a theory existing in developers’ minds, capturing what it does, how intentions map to implementation, and how it can evolve. When that theory fragments, the system becomes a black box.</p><p>Apply this directly to fully agentic coding. If you stop writing code and only review AI output, your ability to reason about code atrophies. Slowly, invisibly, but inevitably. You can’t deeply review what you can no longer deeply understand.</p><p>This isn’t just theory. A <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20245\">2026 randomized study by Shen and Tamkin</a> tested this directly: 52 professional developers learning a new async library were split into AI-assisted and unassisted groups. The AI group scored 17% lower on conceptual understanding, debugging, and code reading. The largest gap was in debugging, the exact skill you need to catch what AI gets wrong. One hour of passive AI-assisted work produced measurable skill erosion.</p><p>The insidious part is that you don’t notice the decline because the tool compensates for it. You feel productive. The PRs are shipping. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s research on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)\">flow</a> showed that the state of flow depends on a balance between challenge and skill. Your mind needs to be stretched just enough. Real flow produces growth. Rachel Thomas called what AI-assisted work produces <a href=\"https://www.fast.ai/posts/2026-01-28-dark-flow/\">“dark flow”</a>, a term borrowed from gambling research, describing the trance-like state slot machines are designed to induce. You feel absorbed, but the challenge-skill balance is gone because the AI handles the challenge. It feels like the flow state of deep work, but the feedback loop is broken. You’re not getting better, you’re getting dependent.</p><p>There’s this observation that keeps coming up in HN comments: if the AI writes all the code and you only review it, where does the skill to review come from? You can’t have one without the other. You don’t learn to recognize good code by reading about it in a textbook, or a PR. You learn by writing bad code, getting it torn apart, and building intuition through years of practice.</p><p>This creates what I’d call the review paradox: the more AI writes, the less qualified humans become to review what it wrote. The Shen-Tamkin study puts numbers on this. Developers who fully delegated to AI finished tasks fastest but scored worst on evaluations. The novices who benefit most from AI productivity are exactly the ones who need debugging skills to supervise it, and AI erodes those skills first.</p><p>Storey’s proposed fix is simple: “require humans to understand each AI-generated change before deployment.” That’s the right answer. It’s also the one that gets skipped first when velocity is the metric.</p><p>This goes deeper than individual skill decay. We used to have juniors, mids, seniors, staff engineers, architects. It was a pipeline where each level built on years of hands-on struggle. A junior spends years writing code that is rejected during the code review not because they were not careful, but didn’t know better. It’s how you build the judgment that separates someone who can write a function from someone who can architect a system. You can’t become a senior overnight.</p><p>Unless you use AI, of course. Now, a junior with Claude Code (Opus 4.5+) delivers PRs that look like senior engineer work. And overall that’s a good thing, I think. But does it mean that the senior hat fits everyone now? From day one? But the head underneath hasn’t changed. That junior doesn’t know  that architecture was chosen. From my experience, sometimes CC misses a new DB transaction where it’s needed. Sometimes it creates a lock on a resource, that shouldn’t be locked, due to number of reasons. I can defend my decisions and I enjoy when my code is challenged, when reviewers disagree, and we have a discussion. What will a junior do? Ask Claude.</p><p>It’s a two-sided collapse. Seniors who stop writing code and only review AI output lose their own depth. Juniors who skip the struggle never build it. Organizations are spending senior time every day on reviews while simultaneously breaking the mechanisms that create it. The pipeline that produced senior engineers, writing bad code, getting bad code reviewed, building intuition through failure, is being bypassed entirely. Nobody’s talking about what happens when that pipeline runs dry.</p><h2>What C-Levels Got Right and Wrong</h2><p>The problem is that predictions come from people selling AI or trying to prop the stock with AI hype. They have every incentive to accelerate adoption and zero accountability when the timelines slip, which, historically, they always do. And “50% of code characters” at Google, a company that has built its own models, tooling, and infrastructure from scratch, says very little about what your team can achieve with off-the-shelf agents next Monday.</p><p>AI adoption is not a switch to flip, rather a skill to calibrate. It’s not as simple as mandating specific tools, setting “AI-first” policies, measuring developers on how much AI they use (/r/ExperiencedDevs is full of these stories). A lot of good practices like usage of design patterns, proper test coverage, manual testing before merging, are often skipped these days because it reduces the pace. AI broke it? AI will fix it. You need a review? AI will do it. Not even Greptile or CodeRabbit. Just delegate the PR to Claude Code reviewer agent. Or Gemini. Or Codex. Pick your poison.</p><p>And here’s what actually happens when you force the AI usage. One developer on r/ExperiencedDevs <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1o643iz/i_am_blissfully_using_ai_to_do_absolutely_nothing/\">described</a> their company tracking AI usage per engineer: “I just started asking my bots to do random things I don’t even care about. The other day I told Claude to examine random directories to ‘find bugs’ or answer questions I already knew the answer to.” <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1r4u0mo/comment/o5e5r2w/\">This thread</a> is full of engineers reporting that AI has made code reviews “infinitely harder due to the AI slop produced by tech leads who have been off the tools long enough to be dangerous.”</p><p>This is sad, because being able to work with the AI tools is a perk for developers and since it improves pace, it’s something management wants as well. It’s obvious that the people gaming the metrics (not really using the AI the way the should) would be fired on the spot if the management learned how they are gaming the metrics (and it’s fair), but they are gaming the metrics because they don’t want to be fired…</p><p>Who should be responsible for setting the threshold of AI usage at the company? What if your top performing engineer just refuses to use AI? What if the newly hired junior uses AI all the time? These are the new questions and management is trying to find an answer to them, but it’s not as simple as measuring the AI usage.</p><p>This is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law\">Goodhart’s law</a> in action: “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” Track AI usage per engineer and you won’t get better engineering, you’ll get compliance theater. Developers game the metrics, resent the tools, and the actual productivity gains that AI  deliver get buried under organizational dysfunction.</p><h2>The Cost Nobody Talks About</h2><p>The financial cost is obvious. Agent time for non-trivial features is measured in hours, and those hours aren’t free. But the human cost is potentially worse, and it’s barely discussed.</p><p>Writing code can put you in a flow state, mentioned before. That deep, focused, creative problem-solving where hours disappear and you emerge with something you built and understand. And you’re proud of it. Someone wrote under your PR “Good job!” and gave you an approval. Reviewing AI-generated code does not do this. It’s the opposite. It’s a mental drain.</p><p>Developers need the dopamine hit of creation. That’s not a perk, it’s what keeps good engineers engaged, learning, retained, and prevents burnout. The joy of coding is probably what allowed them to become experienced devs in the first place. Replace creation with oversight and you get faster burnout, not faster shipping. You’ve turned engineering, the creative work, into the worst form of QA. The AI does all the art, the human folds the laundry.</p><p>I use AI every day. I use AI heavily at work, I use AI in my sideprojects, and I don’t want to go back. I love it! That’s why I’m worried. I’m afraid I became addicted and dependent. I’ve implemented countless custom commands, skills, and agents. I check CC release notes daily. And I know many are in similar situation right now, and we all wonder about what the future brings. Are we going to replace ourselves with AI? Or will we be responsible for cleaning AI slop? What’s the right amount of AI usage for me?</p><p>AI is just a tool. An extraordinarily powerful one, but a tool nonetheless. You wouldn’t mandate that every engineer uses a specific IDE, or measure people on how many lines they write per day (…right?). You’d let them pick the tools that make  most effective and measure what actually matters, the work that ships.</p><p>The right amount of AI is not zero. And it’s not maximum.</p><p>The Shen-Tamkin study identified six distinct AI interaction patterns among developers. Three led to poor learning: full delegation, progressive reliance, and outsourcing debugging to AI. Three preserved learning even with full AI access: asking for explanations, posing conceptual questions, and writing code independently while using AI for clarification. The differentiator wasn’t whether developers used AI, it was whether they stayed cognitively engaged.</p><p>Software engineering was never just about typing code. It’s defining the problem well, understanding the problem, translating the language from business to product to code, clarifying ambiguity, making tradeoffs, understanding what breaks when you change something. Someone has to do that before AGI, and AGI is nowhere close (luckily). You’re on call, the phone rings at 3am, can you triage the issue without an agent? If not, you’ve probably taken AI coding too far. If the AI usage becomes a new performance metric of developer, maybe using AI too often, too much, should be discouraged as well? Not because these tools are bad, but because the coding skills are worth maintaining.</p><h3>The Risk of Too Little (anecdata)</h3><p>If you’re using no AI at all in 2026, you are leaving real gains on the table:</p><ul><li> AI is genuinely better than Google for navigating unfamiliar codebases, understanding legacy code, and finding relevant patterns. This alone justifies having it in your workflow (since 2023, Cursor etc)</li><li><strong>Boilerplate and scaffolding.</strong> Writing the hundredth CRUD endpoint, config file, or test scaffold by hand when an agent can produce it in seconds isn’t craftsmanship, it’s stubbornness. Just use AI. You’re not a CRUD developer anymore anyway, because we all wear many hats these days (post 2025 Sonnet)</li><li> The investigate, plan, implement, test, validate cycle that works with customized agents is a real improvement in how features get delivered. Hours instead of days for non-trivial work. It’s not the 10x that was promised, but 2x or 4x on an established codebases is low-hanging fruit. You must understand the output though and all the decisions AI made! (post 2025 Opus 4.5)</li><li> “What does this module do? How does this API work? What would break if I changed this?” AI is excellent at these questions. It won’t replace reading the code, but it’ll get you to the right file in the right minute. (since 2023)</li></ul><p>Refusing to use AI out of principle is as irrational as adopting it out of hype.</p><h3>The Risk of Too Much (anecdata and my predictions)</h3><p>If you go all-in on autonomous AI coding (especially without learning how it all actually works), you risk something worse than slow velocity, you risk  degradation:</p><ul><li><strong>Bugs that look like features.</strong> AI-generated code passes CI. The types check. The tests are green. And somewhere inside there’s a subtle logic error, a hallucinated edge case, a pattern that’ll collapse under load. In domains like finance or healthcare, a wrong number that doesn’t throw an error is worse than a crash. (less and less relevant, but still relevant)</li><li><strong>A codebase nobody understands.</strong> When the agent writes everything and humans only review, six months later nobody on the team can explain why the system is architected the way it is. The AI made choices. Nobody questioned them because the tests passed. Storey <a href=\"https://margaretstorey.com/blog/2026/02/09/cognitive-debt/\">describes</a> a student team that hit exactly this wall: they couldn’t make simple changes without breaking things, and the problem wasn’t messy code, it was that no one could explain why certain design decisions had been made. Her conclusion: “velocity without understanding is not sustainable.” (will always be a problem, IMO)</li><li> Everything in the Digital Dementia section above. Skills you stop practicing will decline. (will always be a problem, IMO)</li><li><strong>The seniority pipeline drying up.</strong> Also covered above. This one takes years to manifest, which is exactly why nobody’s planning for it. (It’s a new problem, I have no idea what it looks like in the future)</li><li> Reviewing AI output all day without the dopamine of creation is not a sustainable job description. (Old problem, but potentially hits faster?)</li></ul><p>Here’s what keeps me up at night. By every metric on every dashboard, AI-assisted human development and human-assisted AI development is improving. More PRs shipped. More features delivered. Faster cycle times. The charts go up and to the right.</p><p>But metrics don’t capture what’s happening underneath. The mental fatigue of reviewing code you didn’t write all day. The boredom of babysitting an agent instead of solving problems. The slow, invisible erosion of the hard skills that made you good at this job in the first place. You stop holding the architecture in your head because the agent handles it. You stop thinking through edge cases because the tests pass. You stop  to dig deep because it’s easier to prompt and approve. There’s no spark in you anymore.</p><p>In this meme the developers are the butter robot. The ones with no mental capacity to review the plans and PRs from AI, will only click Accept, instead of doing the creative, challenging work. Oh the irony.</p><p>Simon Willison, one of the most ambitious developer of our time, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/cognitive-debt/\">admitted this is already happening to him</a>. On projects where he prompted entire features without reviewing implementations, he “no longer has a firm mental model of what they can do and how they work.”</p><p>And then, one day, the metrics start slipping… Not because the tool got worse, but because you did. Not from lack of effort, but from lack of practice. It’s a feedback loop that looks like progress right up until it doesn’t.</p><p>No executive wants to measure this. “What is the effect of AI usage on our engineers’ cognitive abilities over 18 months?” is not an easy KPI. It doesn’t fit in a quarterly review. It doesn’t get tracked, and what doesn’t get tracked doesn’t get managed, until it shows up as a production incident that nobody on the team can debug without an agent, and the agent can’t debug either.</p><p>I’m not anti-AI, I like it a lot. I’m addicted to prompting, I get high from it. I’m just worried that this new dependency degrades us over time, quietly, and nobody’s watching for it.</p>","contentLength":19251,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47194847"},{"title":"Don't trust AI agents","url":"https://nanoclaw.dev/blog/nanoclaw-security-model","date":1772282372,"author":"gronky_","guid":210,"unread":true,"content":"<p>When you’re building with AI agents, they should be treated as untrusted and potentially malicious. Whether you’re worried about prompt injection, a model trying to escape its sandbox, or something nobody’s thought of yet, regardless of what your threat model is, you shouldn’t be trusting the agent. The right approach isn’t better permission checks or smarter allowlists. It’s architecture that assumes agents will misbehave and contains the damage when they do.</p><p>OpenClaw runs directly on the host machine by default. It has an opt-in Docker sandbox mode, but it’s turned off out of the box, and most users never turn it on. Without it, security relies entirely on application-level checks: allowlists, confirmation prompts, a set of “safe” commands. These checks come from a place of implicit trust that the agent isn’t going to try to do something wrong. Once you adopt the mindset that an agent is potentially malicious, it’s obvious that application-level blocks aren’t enough. They don’t provide hermetic security. A determined or compromised agent can find ways around them.</p><p>In NanoClaw, container isolation is a core part of the architecture. Each agent runs in its own container, on Docker or an Apple Container on macOS. Containers are ephemeral, created fresh per invocation and destroyed afterward. The agent runs as an unprivileged user and can only see directories that have been explicitly mounted in. A container boundary is enforced by the OS.</p><p>Even when OpenClaw’s sandbox is enabled, all agents share the same container. You might have one agent as a personal assistant and another for work, in different WhatsApp groups or Telegram channels. They’re all in the same environment, which means information can leak between agents that are supposed to be accessing different data.</p><p>Agents shouldn’t trust each other any more than you trust them. In NanoClaw, each agent gets its own container, filesystem, and Claude session history. Your personal assistant can’t see your work agent’s data because they run in completely separate sandboxes.</p><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 960 460\" font-family=\"'JetBrains Mono', 'SF Mono', 'Fira Code', monospace\" role=\"img\" aria-label=\"Shared container vs per-agent containers: in a shared container all agents see everything, with per-agent containers each agent is isolated\"></svg><p>The container boundary is the hard security layer — the agent can’t escape it regardless of configuration. On top of that, a mount allowlist at <code>~/.config/nanoclaw/mount-allowlist.json</code> acts as an additional layer of defense-in-depth: it exists to prevent the  from accidentally mounting something that shouldn’t be exposed, not to prevent the agent from breaking out. Sensitive paths (, , , , , ) are blocked by default. The allowlist lives outside the project directory, so a compromised agent can’t modify its own permissions. The host application code is mounted read-only, so nothing an agent does can persist after the container is destroyed.</p><p>People in your groups shouldn’t be trusted either. Non-main groups are untrusted by default. Other groups, and the people in them, can’t message other chats, schedule tasks for other groups, or view other groups’ data. Anyone in a group could send a prompt injection, and the security model accounts for that.</p><h2>Don’t trust what you can’t read</h2><p>OpenClaw has nearly half a million lines of code, 53 config files, and over 70 dependencies. This breaks the basic premise of open source security. Chromium has 35+ million lines, but you trust Google’s review processes. Most open source projects work the other way: they stay small enough that many eyes can actually review them. Nobody has reviewed OpenClaw’s 400,000 lines. It was written in weeks with no proper review process. Complexity is where vulnerabilities hide, and <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2026/02/19/running-openclaw-safely-identity-isolation-runtime-risk/\">Microsoft’s analysis</a> confirmed this: OpenClaw’s risks could emerge through normal API calls, because no one person could see the full picture.</p><p>NanoClaw is one process and a handful of files. We rely heavily on Anthropic’s Agent SDK, the wrapper around Claude Code, for session management, memory compaction, and a lot more, instead of reinventing the wheel. A competent developer can review the entire codebase in an afternoon. This is <a href=\"https://nanoclaw.dev/#philosophy\">a deliberate constraint, not a limitation</a>. Our <a href=\"https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\">contribution guidelines</a> accept bug fixes, security fixes, and simplifications only.</p><p>New functionality comes through skills: instructions with a full working reference implementation that a coding agent merges into your codebase. You review exactly what code will be added before it lands. And you only add the integrations you actually need. Every installation ends up as a few thousand lines of code tailored to the owner’s exact requirements.</p><p>This is the real difference. With a monolithic codebase of 400,000 lines, even if you only enable two integrations, the rest of the code is still there. It’s still loaded, still part of your attack surface, still reachable by prompt injections and rogue agents. You can’t disentangle what’s active from what’s dormant. You can’t audit it because you can’t even define the boundary of what “your code” is. With skills, the boundary is obvious: it’s a few thousand lines, it’s all code you chose to add, and you can read every line of it. The core is actually getting smaller over time: WhatsApp support, for example, is being pulled out and packaged as a skill.</p><p>If a hallucination or a misbehaving agent can cause a security issue, then the security model is broken. Security has to be enforced outside the agentic surface, not depend on the agent behaving correctly. Containers, mount restrictions, and filesystem isolation all exist so that even when an agent does something unexpected, the blast radius is contained.</p><p>None of this eliminates risk. An AI agent with access to your data is inherently a high-risk arrangement. But the right response is to make that trust as narrow and as verifiable as possible. Don’t trust the agent.

The Pentagon has said it doesn't intend to use AI in those ways, but requires AI companies to allow their models to be used \"for all lawful purposes.\"</p><p>The government had also threatened to invoke the Korean War-era Defense Production Act  to compel Anthropic to allow use of its tools and, at the same time, warned it would label Anthropic a supply chain risk.</p><p>In his post carrying out the latter threat, Hegseth said Anthropic had \"delivered a master class in arrogance and betrayal as well as a textbook case of how not to do business with the United States Government or the Pentagon.\" He accused the company of trying to \"seize veto power over the operational decisions of the United States military.\"</p><p>He said the department would not waver from its position: \"the Department of War must have full, unrestricted access to Anthropic's models for every LAWFUL purpose in defense of the Republic.\"</p><p>\"America's warfighters will never be held hostage by the ideological whims of Big Tech. This decision is final,\" Hegseth concluded.</p><p>The government ban comes at a time when Anthropic is under heightened scrutiny, since the company, which is valued at <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-30-billion-series-g-funding-380-billion-post-money-valuation\" target=\"_blank\">$380 billion</a>, is planning to go public this year.</p><p>While the Pentagon contract worth as much as $200 million is a relatively small portion of Anthropic's $14 billion in revenue, it's unclear how the friction with the administration will sit with investors or affect other deals the company has to license its AI model to non-government partners.</p><p>Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has pointed out that the company's valuation and revenue have only grown since it took a stand against Trump officials over how AI can be deployed on the battlefield.</p><p>Whether AI companies can set restrictions on how the government uses their technology has emerged as a major sticking point in recent months between Anthropic and the Trump administration.</p><p>On Thursday, Amodei said the company would not budge in the face of the Pentagon's threats. \"We cannot in good conscience accede to their request,\" he wrote in a lengthy <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-department-of-war\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a>.</p><div><div><div><div aria-label=\"Image caption\"><p>\n                A 2024 file photo of Dario Amodei, CEO and cofounder of Anthropic.\n                <b aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    Jeff Chiu/Associated Press\n                    \n                </b></p></div></div></div></div><p>\"Anthropic understands that the Department of War, not private companies, makes military decisions.

His beloved wife Karen and daughter Jane were at his side. </div><p>Dan was born in Peoria, Illinois on April 4, 1948 to his parents Robert A. Simmons and Kathryn H. (Catton) Simmons. His childhood was filled with happy memories of riding bikes with friends throughout cornfield-lined roads in the Midwest, first in Brimfield, Illinois and then in Pittsboro, Indiana. </p><p>He graduated with an English degree from Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana, and earned a graduate degree in education from Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. </p><p>Dan embarked on a career as an elementary school teacher in Missouri, later teaching in Buffalo, New York, and Longmont, Colorado, where he taught sixth grade. During his eighteen years in education, he co-created and taught a districtwide program for gifted students that was the first of its kind, and he was named a finalist for the Colorado Teacher of the Year.</p><p>Dan had a profound passion for teaching, and was beloved by many of his students for his innovative, energizing, and creative approach in the classroom. He brought science to life for his students with Carl Sagan’s Cosmos series, ran interactive simulations on topics like the Cuban Missile Crisis and the harmful effects of discrimination, and incorporated his love of topics like Greek mythology, film, and art into his lectures. </p><p>Every day after lunch, Dan told his students a daily installment of an epic tale that started on the first day of school. As they listened, the students would color illustrations that he’d drawn for them. When the story finally came to an end on the last day of school, many recall being reduced to tears. This story would go on to become Dan’s Hyperion cantos (1989), a critically acclaimed, four-part science fiction classic. </p><p>Over the course of his life, former students would tell Dan that they still had their notes from his Black history lectures, and that he had inspired their lifelong love of reading and writing. Long after he left the classroom, he continued to share what he loved with everyone around him, teaching his grandchildren all about the 1950s era monster movies that he loved, and giving endearingly professorial introductions to films that he and Karen shared with scores of friends when they hosted backyard summer movies.</p><p>In addition to teaching, reading and writing were the great loves of Dan’s life. As a child, he read everything he could find, spanning from comic books to literary classics and nonfiction. Throughout his life, he particularly loved learning about space, science, and history. Starting in early childhood, Dan had a remarkable gift for storytelling, which would become his life's work. His first published story came out on the day his daughter Jane was born, a day that confirmed to him that his true love was his family.</p><p>In 1987, Dan took a daring leap and left teaching to follow his dream to work full-time as an author. His debut novel, Song of Kali (1985), was inspired by three days that he spent in Kolkata, India, and won the 1986 World Fantasy Award. </p><p>He went on to write thirty-one novels and short story collections, many of which were honored with accolades ranging from Bram Stoker awards, Locus awards, the Shirley Jackson award, and the prestigious Hugo award. His most meaningful award was an honorary doctorate from Wabash College, a place that changed his life and set him on a path towards a life well lived. His titles have been published in 28 foreign countries and translated into at least 20 languages, and his many book tours, conferences, and workshops took him all over the world. </p><p>Like his early reading pursuits, Dan always wrote about what he loved. He defied literary norms by writing across genres, switching between major publishers, and defying pressure to conform to formulaic novels. His works span from historical fiction to horror, hard-boiled crime, and speculative fiction. They explore topics ranging from Ernest Hemingway’s WWII Cuban spy ring to mountain climbing in the Himalayas. In 2018, his novel The Terror (2007) was released as an AMC limited series. Dan was a profoundly curious learner who delighted in connecting with other curious minds, and the many stories he dreamed up helped him connect with others throughout his entire life.</p><p>Dan is predeceased by his parents and his brother Ted. He is survived by his loving wife and daughter, Karen and Jane Simmons; his beloved grandchildren, Milo and Lucia Glenn; and his brother, Wayne Simmons.</p><p>Dan's cremation has been entrusted to Ahlberg Funeral Chapel of Longmont, Colorado. His ashes will be scattered at a later date.

Launch is now on hold until at least April 1.</p><p>The Artemis III mission, which had been expected to land astronauts near the moon's south pole in 2028, now will be redefined and rescheduled — launching in 2027 but not to the moon, Isaacman said. Instead, the yet-to-be-named astronauts will rendezvous and dock in orbit closer to home with one or both of the commercially built lunar landers now under development at Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin.</p><p>The idea is to gain valuable near-term flight experience before attempting a moon landing with astronauts on board. With Artemis III under its belt, NASA hopes to launch two moon landing missions in 2028, Artemis IV and V, using one or both landers, and to continue with one moonshot per year thereafter.</p><p>\"What helps us get to the moon? Well, for sure, rendezvous and docking with one or ideally both landers, that gives you an opportunity to do some integrated testing of a vehicle that we are going to depend upon the following year to take those astronauts down to the surface of the moon,\" Isaacman told CBS News.</p><p>The revised Artemis III mission will also give astronauts a chance to test out new spacesuits that future moonwalkers will use.</p><p>\"It's an opportunity to … actually have the suits in microgravity, even if we don't go outside the vehicle in them. You get a lot of good learning from that,\" Isaacman said.</p><p>The Artemis III test flight with one or two lander dockings in Earth orbit is similar in concept to Apollo 9, which launched a command module and lander to Earth orbit for flight tests in 1969 and helped pave the way to the  landing four months later.</p><p>Isaacman said SpaceX and Blue Origin are \"both looking to do uncrewed landing demonstrations as part of the existing agreement.\"</p><p>\"So we want to just take advantage of this to set up both vendors for future success on a lunar landing,\" he said. \"This is the proper way to do it, if it works out from a timing perspective, to be able to rendezvous and dock with both. ... This, again, is the right way to proceed in order to have a high confidence opportunity in '28 to land.\"</p><p>The Artemis IV and V missions in 2028 will use whichever landers are deemed ready for service. If only one company's lander is available, that lander would be used for both missions, an official said. If both are available, one would be used for one flight and one for the other.</p><p>Launching Artemis III, IV and V before the end of 2028 will not be easy, and Isaacman said it is essential that NASA rebuild its workforce and regain the technical competence to support a higher launch cadence, moving from one flight every 18 months or so to a flight every year. That pace, he argued, will reduce risk.</p><p>\"When you regain these core competencies and you start exercising your muscles, your skills do not atrophy,\" he said. \"It's safer. And yes, you are buying down risk, because you're able to test things in low Earth orbit before you need to get to the moon, which is exactly what we did during the Apollo era.\"</p><p>He said he did not blame NASA's contractors for the current slow pace of Artemis launches. Instead, \"we should have made better decisions (in the past) and said, you don't go from Artemis II to landing on the moon with Artemis III.\"</p><h2>Safety advisers called for changes to \"high risk\" plans</h2><p>The Artemis overhaul was announced two days after the release of a report by the lAerospace Safety Advisory Panel that said the original plan to move directly from Artemis II to a lunar touchdown in 2028 using a SpaceX lander did not have the proper margin of safety and did not appear to be realistically achievable.</p><p>The panel raised concerns about the number of \"firsts\" required by that mission in its current form and recommended that NASA \"restructure the Artemis Program to create a more balanced risk posture for Artemis III and future missions.\"</p><p>The plan outlined by Isaacman appears to address many of the core issues raised by the safety panel.</p><p>Officials said Isaacman had discussed accelerating lander development with both SpaceX and Blue Origin and that both were on board. He also discussed the accelerated Artemis overhaul with Boeing, which manages the SLS rocket and builds its massive first stage; with United Launch Alliance, builder of the rocket's upper stage, Orion-builder Lockheed Martin and other Artemis contractors.</p><p>All, the official said, were in agreement.</p><p>\"Boeing is a proud partner to the Artemis mission and our team is honored to contribute to NASA's vision for American space leadership,\" Steve Parker, the president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security, said in a statement. \"We are ready to meet the increased demand.\"</p><p>SpaceX said, \"We look forward to working with NASA to fly missions that demonstrate valuable progress towards establishing a permanent, sustainable presence on the lunar surface.\"</p><p>And Blue Origin responded, \"Let's go! We're all in!\"</p><p>Isaacman also said the agency would halt work to develop a more powerful version of the SLS rocket's upper stage, known as the Exploration Upper Stage, or EUS. Instead, NASA will go forward with a \"standardized,\" less powerful stage but one that will minimize major changes between flights and utilize the same launch gantry.</p><p>Under the original Artemis architecture, NASA planned on multiple versions of the SLS rocket, ranging from the \"Block 1\" vehicle currently in use to a more powerful EUS-equipped Block 1B and eventually an even bigger Block 2 model using advanced solid rocket boosters. The latter two versions required use of a taller mobile launch gantry, already well under construction at the Kennedy Space Center.</p><p>\"It is needlessly complicated to alter the configuration of the SLS and Orion stack to undertake subsequent Artemis missions,\" Amit Kshatriya, NASA's associate administrator, said in a statement.</p><p>\"The entire sequence of Artemis flights needs to represent a step-by-step build-up of capability, with each step bringing us closer to our ability to perform the landing missions. Each step needs to be big enough to make progress, but not so big that we take unnecessary risk given previous learnings.\"</p><p>As a result, NASA will stick with the current version of the SLS with the addition of the \"standardized\" upper stage. No other details were provided.</p><p>Isaacman closed out the CBS interview by saying flight-tested hardware, a revitalized work force and a more Apollo-like management strategy are only part of the story.</p><p>\"There's another ingredient that's required, and that's the orbital economy, whether it happens in low-Earth orbit or on the lunar surface,\" Isaacman said.</p><p>\"We've got to do something where we can get more value out of space and the lunar surface than we put into it. And that's how you really ignite an economy, and that's how everything we want to do in space is not perpetually dependent on taxpayers.\"</p><section><p>\n                  \n        contributed to this report.\n    </p></section>","contentLength":8969,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47182483"}],"tags":["dev"]}
