The withdrawal by the current  represents yet another chapter in a long-running battle between privacy advocates and lawmakers who believe they can compromise encryption in the name of public safety. While this latest defeat is a victory for digital rights, the fight is far from over, and the <em>fundamental misunderstanding of encryption technology</em> continues to plague policy discussions across Europe.</p><svg viewBox=\"0 0 800 400\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"></svg><h2>A zombie proposal that refuses to die</h2><p>Since its introduction in 2022, Chat Control has become what privacy advocates call a , repeatedly resurrected despite consistent opposition from civil society, technical experts, and the public. The <strong>Electronic Frontier Foundation</strong> and <a href=\"https://www.globalencryption.org/2024/05/joint-statement-on-the-dangers-of-the-may-2024-council-of-the-eu-compromise-proposal-on-eu-csam/\">more than 80 civil society organizations</a> have strongly opposed the legislation, which would mandate client-side scanning of encrypted communications under the guise of combating child sexual abuse material.</p><p>The pattern has become predictable. EU lawmakers introduce the proposal, claiming it includes safeguards for privacy. Technical experts explain why those safeguards are illusory. Public pressure mounts. The proposal is withdrawn or modified. Then, after a brief hiatus, it returns with minor tweaks, and the cycle begins anew. This latest withdrawal by the  follows the same script, but the underlying issues remain unresolved.</p><p>What makes this particularly frustrating is that the fundamental problem with Chat Control has never been addressed. The proposal seeks to create what privacy experts call a “backdoor” into encryption, allowing authorities to scan messages before they’re encrypted or after they’re decrypted. Proponents argue this preserves encryption while enabling content moderation, but this reveals a <em>dangerous misunderstanding</em> of how encryption actually works. Creating any mechanism to access encrypted content inherently weakens the entire system, making it vulnerable not just to authorized access but to malicious actors as well.</p><h2>The technical impossibility of “safe” scanning</h2><p>The core issue with Chat Control and similar proposals lies in a fundamental misunderstanding of encryption technology. End-to-end encryption works because only the sender and recipient possess the keys to decrypt messages. Any third party, whether a government agency or a tech company, cannot read the contents. This is not a design choice but a mathematical certainty that ensures the security of billions of communications daily.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/why-adding-client-side-scanning-breaks-end-end-encryption\">Client-side scanning</a>, the technical approach favored by Chat Control advocates, attempts to circumvent this limitation by analyzing messages on users’ devices before encryption or after decryption. While this might sound like a clever workaround, it fundamentally breaks the security model of encryption. If a device can scan and report on message content, so can malware, hackers, or authoritarian governments who might compel tech companies to expand the scope of scanning.</p><p>Security researchers have repeatedly demonstrated that there is <em>no way to create a scanning system</em> that only works for “good guys.”  learned this lesson the hard way in 2021 when it proposed a similar system for detecting child abuse imagery in iCloud photos. The backlash from security experts was swift and devastating, forcing the company to abandon the plan. The same security vulnerabilities that would enable Chat Control would inevitably be exploited by malicious actors, putting everyone at greater risk.</p><svg viewBox=\"0 0 800 500\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"></svg><p>Moreover, the scope creep inherent in surveillance technologies is well documented. A system initially designed to detect illegal content could easily be expanded to monitor political dissent, religious expression, or any other communication governments deem problematic. <strong>Countries around the world</strong> are watching the EU’s actions closely. If Chat Control were to pass, it would set a dangerous precedent that authoritarian regimes would eagerly exploit, claiming they’re simply following Europe’s lead in implementing “reasonable” content moderation.</p><h2>Public pressure and the power of resistance</h2><p>The withdrawal of Chat Control demonstrates the <em>critical importance of sustained public engagement</em> in technology policy. Unlike previous instances where technical proposals sailed through legislative processes with little public awareness, this fight has been characterized by unprecedented mobilization from civil society organizations, technology companies, security researchers, and ordinary citizens concerned about their digital rights.</p><p>Organizations like the <strong>Electronic Frontier Foundation</strong>, , and numerous national privacy advocacy groups have played a crucial role in educating the public about the risks of Chat Control. Their efforts have included detailed technical explanations, legal analysis, and coordination of opposition campaigns that have reached millions of Europeans. This groundswell of opposition has made it politically toxic for lawmakers to support the proposal, at least in its current form.</p><p>The effectiveness of this resistance offers important lessons for future policy battles. First, technical expertise matters. When security researchers speak with a unified voice about the impossibility of safe backdoors, it becomes harder for politicians to dismiss concerns as alarmist. Second, coalition-building across different sectors strengthens opposition. When <a href=\"https://edri.org/our-work/chat-control-what-is-actually-going-on/\">civil liberties groups</a>, tech companies, and individual users all oppose a policy, it suggests the problems are real and widespread. Third, sustained pressure is essential because, as Chat Control demonstrates, bad proposals rarely die on the first attempt.</p><p>However, this victory should be tempered with realism. The forces pushing for Chat Control have not given up, and the underlying political dynamics that gave rise to the proposal remain unchanged. Politicians face genuine pressure to be seen as “doing something” about online harms, particularly regarding child safety. Until alternative approaches that don’t compromise encryption gain political traction, proposals like Chat Control will continue to resurface.</p><h2>The path forward requires education and alternatives</h2><p>The repeated resurrection of Chat Control points to a deeper problem in how technology policy is made. Many lawmakers genuinely believe they can have both strong encryption and government access to encrypted content. This belief persists despite unanimous opposition from the cryptographic community because the political incentives favor appearing tough on crime over understanding complex technical realities.</p><p>Breaking this cycle requires a <em>fundamental shift in how we approach online safety</em>. Rather than seeking technological magic bullets that promise security without trade-offs, policymakers need to invest in solutions that actually work. This includes better funding for law enforcement training and tools that don’t require breaking encryption, improved international cooperation on criminal investigations, and addressing the root causes of online exploitation through social programs and education.</p><p> also bear responsibility for developing and promoting genuinely privacy-preserving safety features. End-to-end encrypted platforms can implement abuse prevention measures that don’t involve content scanning, such as metadata analysis, user reporting systems, and account-level restrictions for suspicious behavior. While these approaches may be less comprehensive than mass surveillance, they achieve meaningful safety improvements without the catastrophic privacy trade-offs of backdoors.</p><p>Looking ahead, the privacy community cannot simply celebrate the withdrawal of Chat Control and move on. The next presidency of the EU Council will bring new opportunities for the proposal to resurface in yet another modified form. Sustained vigilance, continued public education, and proactive development of alternative safety measures will be essential. The fight to protect encryption is not a single battle but an ongoing campaign that requires long-term commitment from everyone who values digital privacy and security.</p><p>The withdrawal of Chat Control is a victory, but it’s a temporary one. The fundamental challenge remains: convincing policymakers that some trade-offs are not worth making, and that breaking encryption to combat illegal content creates far more problems than it solves. Until that message truly sinks in, the zombie proposal will keep rising from the grave, and the privacy community must remain ready to defeat it again and again.</p>","contentLength":8587,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45783114"},{"title":"GHC now runs in the browser","url":"https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghc-now-runs-in-your-browser/13169","date":1762014563,"author":"kaycebasques","guid":212,"unread":true,"content":"<!DOCTYPE html>","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45782981"},{"title":"Updated practice for review articles and position papers in ArXiv CS category","url":"https://blog.arxiv.org/2025/10/31/attention-authors-updated-practice-for-review-articles-and-position-papers-in-arxiv-cs-category/","date":1762009085,"author":"dw64","guid":211,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45782136"},{"title":"SQLite concurrency and why you should care about it","url":"https://jellyfin.org/posts/SQLite-locking/","date":1762001943,"author":"HunOL","guid":209,"unread":true,"content":"<p>SQLite is a powerful database engine, but due to its design, it has limitations that should not be overlooked.</p><p>Jellyfin has used a SQLite-based database for storing most of its data for years, but it has also encountered issues on many systems. In this blog post, I will explain how we address these limitations and how developers using SQLite can apply the same solutions.</p><p>This will be a technical blog post intended for developers and everyone wanting to learn about concurrency.</p><p>Also Jellyfin's implementation of locking for SQLite should be fairly easy to be implemented into another EF Core application if you are facing the same issue.</p><p>SQLite is a file-based database engine running within your application and allows you to store data in a relational structure.\nOverall it gives your application the means of storing structured data as a single file and without having to depend on another application to do so.\nNaturally this also comes at a price. If your application fully manages this file, the assumption must be made that your application is the sole owner of this file, and nobody else will tinker with it while you are writing data to it.</p><p>So an application that wants to use SQLite as its database needs to be the only one accessing it.\nHaving established this fact, an important thought arises: if only a single write operation should be performed on a single file at a time, this rule must also apply to operations within the same application.</p><p>SQLite has a feature that tries to get around this limitation: the Write-Ahead-Log (WAL).\nThe WAL is a separate file that acts as a journal of operations that should be applied to an SQLite file.\nThis allows multiple parallel writes to take place and get enqueued into the WAL.\nWhen another part of the application wants to read data, it reads from the actual database, then scans the WAL for modifications and applies them on the fly.\nThis is not a foolproof solution; there are still scenarios where WAL does not prevent locking conflicts.</p><p>A transaction is supposed to ensure two things.\nModifications made within a transaction can be reverted, either when something goes wrong or when the application decides it should and optionally a transaction may also block other readers from reading data that is modified within a transaction.\nThis is where it gets spicy and we come to the real reason why I am writing this blog post.\nFor some reason on some systems that run Jellyfin when a transaction takes place the SQLite engine reports the database is locked and instead of waiting for the transaction to be resolved the engine refuses to wait and just crashes.\nThis seems to be a not uncommon issue and there are many reports to be found on the issue.</p><p>The factor that makes this issue so bad is that it does not happen reliably. So far we only have one team member where this can be (somewhat) reliably be reproduced which makes this an even worse a bug.\nFrom the reports this issue happens across all operating systems, drive speeds and with or without virtualization.\nSo we do not have any deciding factor identified that even contributes to the likelihood of the issue happening.</p><p>Having established the general theory on how SQLite behaves, we also have to look at the specifics of Jellyfins usage of SQLite.\nDuring normal operations on a recommended setup (Non-Networked Storage and preferably SSD) its unusual for any problems to arise, however the way Jellyfin utilises the SQLite db up to 10.11 is very suboptimal.\nIn versions prior to 10.11 Jellyfin had a bug in its parallel task limit which resulted in exponential overscheduling of library scan operations which hammered the database engine with thousands of parallel write requests that an SQLite engine is simply not able to handle.\nWhile most SQLite engine implementations have retry behavior, they also have timeouts and checks in place to prevent limitless waiting so if we stress the engine enough, it just fails with an error.\nThat and very long running and frankly unoptimized transactions could lead to the database just being overloaded with requests and flaking out.</p><p>Since we moved the codebase over to EF Core proper, we have the tools to actually do something about this as EF Core gives us a structured abstraction level.\nEF Core supports a way of hooking into every command execution or transaction by creating <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/logging-events-diagnostics/interceptors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interceptors</a>.\nWith an interceptor we can finally do the straight forward idea of just \"not\" writing to the database in parallel in a transparent way to the caller.\nThe overall idea is to have multiple strategies of locking. Because all levels of synchronization will inevitably come at the cost of performance, we only want to do it when it is really necessary.\nSo, I decided on three locking strategies:</p><ol></ol><p>As a default, the no-lock behavior does exactly what the name implies. Nothing. This is the default because my research shows that for 99% all of this is not an issue and every interaction at this level will slow down the whole application.</p><p>Both the optimistic and pessimistic behaviors use two interceptors—one for transactions and one for commands—and override  in .</p><h3>Optimistic locking behavior<a href=\"https://jellyfin.org/posts/SQLite-locking/#optimistic-locking-behavior\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Optimistic locking behavior\" title=\"Direct link to Optimistic locking behavior\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h3><p>Optimistic locking means to assume the operation in question will succeed and only handle issues afterwards. In essence this can be boiled down to \"Try and Retry and Retry ...\" for a set number of times until either we succeed with the operation or fail entirely.\nThis still leaves the possibility that we will not actually be able to perform a write, but the introduced overhead is far less than the Pessimistic locking behavior.</p><p>The idea behind how this works is simple: every time two operations try to write to the database, one will always win. The other will fail, wait some time, then retry a few times.</p><p>Jellyfin uses the  library perform the retry behavior and will only retry operations it will find have been locked due to this exact issue.</p><h3>Pessimistic locking behavior<a href=\"https://jellyfin.org/posts/SQLite-locking/#pessimistic-locking-behavior\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Pessimistic locking behavior\" title=\"Direct link to Pessimistic locking behavior\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h3><p>Pessimistic locking always locks when a write to SQLite should be performed. Essentially every time an transaction is started or a write operation on the database is done though EF Core, Jellyfin will wait until all other read operations are finished and then block all other operations may they be read or write until the write in question has been performed.\nThis however means, that Jellyfin can only ever perform a single write to the database, even if it would technically does not need to.</p><p>In theory, an application should have no issue reading from table \"Alice\" while writing to table \"Bob\" however to eliminate all possible sources of concurrency related locking, Jellyfin will only ever allow a single write performed on its database in this mode.\nWhile this will absolutely result in the most stable operation, it will undoubtedly also be the slowest.</p><p>Jellyfin uses a <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/runtime-libraries/system-threading-readerwriterlockslim\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ReaderWriterLockSlim</a> to lock the operations, that means we allow an unlimited number of reads to happen concurrently while only one write may ever be done on the database.</p><h3>The future Smart locking behavior<a href=\"https://jellyfin.org/posts/SQLite-locking/#the-future-smart-locking-behavior\" aria-label=\"Direct link to The future Smart locking behavior\" title=\"Direct link to The future Smart locking behavior\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h3><p>In the future we might also consider combining both modes, to get the best of both worlds.</p><p>Initial testing showed that with both modes, we had great success in handling the underlying issue. While we are not yet sure why this happens only on some systems when others work, we at least now have an option for users previously left out of using Jellyfin.</p><p>When I was researching this topic, I found many reports all over the internet facing the same error but nobody was able to provide a conclusive explanation whats really happening here.\nThere have been similar proposals made to handle it but there wasn't a \"ready to drop in\" solution that handles all the different cases or only code that required massive modifications to every EF Core query.\nJellyfin's implementation of the locking behaviors should be a copy-paste solution for everyone having the same issues as its using interceptors and the caller has no idea of the actual locking behavior.</p>","contentLength":7955,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45781298"},{"title":"Do you know that there is an HTML tables API?","url":"https://christianheilmann.com/2025/10/08/abandonware-of-the-web-do-you-know-that-there-is-an-html-tables-api/","date":1762001901,"author":"begoon","guid":241,"unread":true,"content":"<p>When people turn data into  tables using JavaScript, they either use the  methods (createElement() and the likes), but most of the time just append a huge string and use innerHTML, which always is a security concern.

Profitability was seen as unambitious or even wrong – something to worry about when you hit scale. Why focus on profits when money and valuations were easy to come by?</p><p>But that thinking was always flawed.</p><p>Profitability isn't unambitious; it's controlling your own destiny. It means you don't have to rely on investors for survival. It means you can focus on your unaltered vision and mission. And it means you as a founder decide the pace of growth. And once you experience it, it's hard to imagine doing things any other way.</p><p><a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/ramenprofitable.html\">Paul Graham famously wrote about \"ramen profitability\"</a> – the point where a founding team could survive without external funding. He argued this made startups more attractive to investors, showing they could get customers to pay, were serious about building valuable products, and were disciplined with expenses.</p><p>Graham wrote his essay in 2009. I’d argue that we now live in a world where it’s not just easier to get ramen profitable, but traditionally profitable – while also growing fast.</p><p>At Linear we didn't set out to be profitable but kind of stumbled into it. We believed that to win this market we really needed to build a superior tool. The best way we knew how to do that was to keep the team small and focused. And when we launched after a year in private beta, almost all of our 100 beta users converted to paid customers. To our surprise, we realized it wouldn't take that long to become profitable if we kept the costs in check. Twelve months after launch, we hit profitability, and we've stayed profitable ever since.</p><p>I don't know why hiring massive teams ever became the norm. In my own experience, small teams always delivered better quality, and faster. Maybe it's fear of missing out if you don't grow the team fast. Maybe it's investors whispering that your team is \"understaffed compared to benchmarks.\" Being understaffed compared to benchmarks almost always should be a source of pride, not a problem. People should be surprised how small your team is, not how big it is.</p><p>What holds you back is rarely team size – it's the clarity of your focus, skill and ability to execute. Larger teams mean slower progress, more management overhead, more meetings, more opinions, and usually dilution of vision and standards. Yet growing the team has somehow become a symbol of success.</p><p>At Linear, we hired our first employee after six months and roughly doubled the team each year. With each hire, we make sure they truly elevate the team. We don't set out to hire ten engineers – we hire the next  engineer. This intentional approach has allowed us to maintain both quality and culture.</p><p>The most underrated thing about profitability is how much peace of mind it gives you. Once you're profitable, you stop worrying about survival and focus on what really matters: building something great. Building the way you want. Instead of optimizing for the next fundraising round, you optimize for value creation.</p><p>While profitability might not come quickly for every startup, I believe it's achievable sooner than most think. If you're creating a new market, or truly require massive scale like a social network, or significant upfront investment like a hardware company, it might take longer. But if you're in a category where there isn't hard upfront investment, and you get some level of product-market fit with customers willing to pay, you can probably be profitable. You can decide to become profitable. And usually, it's a decision about how much and how fast you hire.</p><p>Revenue per employee is one of the clearest ways to see you’re hiring appropriately. While some of the best public companies benchmark at $1-2M per employee, for startups it's not unreasonable to target the range of $500k-$1M per employee.</p><p><strong>Understand Your Risk Profile</strong></p><p>Are you building something highly speculative where you're not sure if there's a market for it, or are you building something that already has a market but with a different take on it? In the former case profitability takes longer, but in the latter it could happen right away. Most software today, especially in the B2B space, is about building a modern version of something existing.</p><p><strong>Hire Intentionally and Slower</strong></p><p>For most software startups, ten people before product-market fit should be your ceiling, not your target. After PMF, every hire should address a specific, pressing need – not just fill out an org chart. At Linear, our deliberately slow headcount growth forced us to be selective, which meant making better hires. It also protected our culture, since rapid hiring often dilutes the very things that made your startup special in the first place. When you hire less, you naturally hire better.</p><p>Being profitable doesn't mean you have to be anti-investors. It means you have that choice, and investors are quite interested in profitable companies that also grow fast. You can raise more, less, or nothing. You can wait for the right timing, the right partner, or fund. For most ambitious startups, it can still be a good idea to raise something even if you could get by bootstrapping. Investors can still be helpful, and the additional cash balance can help you to make larger investments, or acquisitions.</p><p>The point is that you can be and are allowed to be profitable as a startup. It's not a bad thing, it's not an oxymoron or as hard as people make it out to be. The secret is that a lot of successful companies actually were quite profitable early on, they just didn't talk about it. When you're profitable, you make decisions based on what's best for your customers and your product, not what's best for impressing investors.</p><p>I didn't set out to build a profitable startup.

Imagine you have a system, which\ncould be anything from the movement of planets to the growth of a population. In this system, there are rules that\ndetermine how it evolves from one moment to the next. These rules tell you what will happen next based on what is\nhappening now. Some examples are, a pendulum, the weather patterns, a flock of birds, the spread of a virus in a\npopulation (we are all too familiar with this one), and stock market.</p><p>There are two primary things to understand about this system:</p><ul><li>: This is like a big collection of all the possible states the system can be in. Each state is like a\nsnapshot of the system at a specific time. This is also called the  or the .</li><li>: These are the rules that takes one state of the system and moves it to the next state. It can be\nrepresented as a function that transforms the system from now to later.</li></ul><p>For instance, when studying population growth, a phase-space (world-state) might consist of the current population size\nand the rate of growth or decline at a specific time. The dynamics would then be derived from models of population\ndynamics, which, considering factors like birth rates, death rates, and carrying capacity of the environment, dictate\nthe changes in population size over time.</p><p>Another way of saying this is that the dynamical systems describe how things change over time, in a space of\npossibilities, governed by a set of rules. Numerous fields such as biology, physics, economics, and applied mathematics,\nstudy systems like these, focusing on the specific rules that dictate their evolution. These rules are grounded in\nrelevant theories, such as Newtonian mechanics, fluid dynamics, and mathematics of economics, among others.</p><p>There are different ways of classifying dynamical systems, and one of the most interesting is the classification into\nchaotic and non-chaotic systems. The change over time in non-chaotic systems is more deterministic as compared to\nchaotic systems which exhibit randomness and unpredictability.</p><p> is the sub branch of dynamical systems that studies chaotic systems and challenges the traditional\ndeterministic views of causality. Most of the natural systems we observe are chaotic in nature, like the weather, a drop\nof ink dissolving in water, social and economic behaviours etc. In contrast, systems like the movement of planets,\npendulums, and simple harmonic oscillators are extremely predictable and non-chaotic.</p><p>Chaos Theory deals with systems that exhibit irregular and unpredictable behavior over time, even though they follow\ndeterministic rules. Having a set of rules that govern the system, and yet exhibit randomness and unpredictability,\nmight seem a bit contradictory, but it is because the rules do not always represent the whole system. In fact, most of\nthe time, these rules are an approximation of the system and that is what leads to the unpredictability. In complex\nsystems, we do not have enough information to come up with a perfect set of rules. And by using incomplete information\nto make predictions, we introduce uncertainty, which amplifies over time, leading to the chaotic behaviour.</p><p>Chaotic systems generally have many non-linear interacting components, which we partially understand (or can partially\nobserve) and which are very sensitive to small changes. A small change in the initial conditions can lead to a\ncompletely different outcome, a phenomenon known as the . In this post, we will try to see the\nbutterfly effect in action but before that, let's talk about .</p><p>To understand Strange Attractors, let's first understand what an attractor is. As discussed earlier, dynamical systems\nare all about . During this change, the system moves through different possible states (remember the\nphase space jargon?). An attractor is a set of states towards which a system tends to settle over time, or you can say,\ntowards which it is . It's like a magnet that pulls the system towards it.</p><p>For example, think of a pendulum. When you release it, it swings back and forth, but eventually, it comes to rest at the\nbottom. The bottom is the attractor in this case. It's the state towards which the pendulum is attracted.</p><p>This happens due to the system's inherent dynamics, which govern how states in the phase space change. Here are some of\nthe reasons why different states get attracted towards attractors:</p><ul><li>: Attractors are stable states of the system, meaning that once the system reaches them, it tends to stay\nthere. This stability arises from the system's dynamics, which push it towards the attractor and keep it there.</li><li>: Many dynamical systems have dissipative forces, which cause the system to lose energy over time. This\nloss of energy leads the system to settle into a lower-energy state, which often corresponds to an attractor. This is\nwhat happens in the case of the pendulum.</li><li>: In some regions of the phase space, the system's dynamics cause trajectories to converge. This\ncontraction effect means that nearby states will tend to come closer together over time, eventually being drawn\ntowards the attractor.</li></ul><p>Some attractors have complex governing equations that can create unpredictable trajectories or behaviours. These\nnonlinear interactions can result in multiple stable states or periodic orbits, towards which the system evolves. These\ncomplex attractors are categorised as . They are called \"strange\" due to their unique\ncharacteristics.</p><ol><li>: Strange attractors often have a fractal-like structure, meaning they display intricate\npatterns that repeat at different scales. This complexity sets them apart from simpler, regular attractors.</li><li><strong>Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions</strong>: Systems with strange attractors are highly sensitive to their initial\nconditions. Small changes in the starting point can lead to vastly different long-term behaviors, a phenomenon known\nas the \"butterfly effect\".</li><li><strong>Unpredictable Trajectories</strong>: The trajectories on a strange attractor never repeat themselves, exhibiting\nnon-periodic motion. The system's behavior appears random and unpredictable, even though it is governed by\ndeterministic rules.</li><li><strong>Emergent Order from Chaos</strong>: Despite their chaotic nature, strange attractors exhibit a form of underlying order.\nPatterns and structures emerge from the seemingly random behavior, revealing the complex dynamics at play.</li></ol><p>You can observe most of these characteristics in the visualisation. The one which is most fascinating to observe is the\nbutterfly effect.</p><blockquote><p>A butterfly can flutter its wings over a flower in China and cause a hurricane in the Caribbean.</p></blockquote><p>One of the defining features of strange attractors is their sensitivity to initial conditions. This means that small\nchanges in the starting state of the system can lead to vastly different long-term behaviors, a phenomenon known as the\n. In chaotic systems, tiny variations in the initial conditions can amplify over time, leading to\ndrastically different outcomes.</p><p>In our visualisation, let's observe this behavior on Thomas Attractor. It is governed by the following equations:</p><p>A small change in the parameter  can lead to vastly different particle trajectories and the overall shape of the\nattractor. Change this value in the control panel and observe the butterfly effect in action.</p><p>There is another way of observing the butterfly effect in this visualisation. Change the  from  to\n in the control panel and observe how the particles move differently in the two cases. The particles\neventually get attracted to the same states but have different trajectories.</p><p>This visualization required rendering a large number of particles using Three.js. To achieve this efficiently, we used a\ntechnique called . This method handles iterative updates of particle systems directly on the GPU,\nminimizing data transfers between the CPU and GPU. It utilizes two frame buffer objects (FBOs) that alternate roles: One\nstores the current state of particles and render them on the screen, while the other calculates the next state.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Setting Up Frame Buffer Objects (FBOs):</strong> We start by creating two FBOs,  and , to hold the current and\nnext state of particles. These buffers store data such as particle positions in RGBA channels, making efficient use\nof GPU resources.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shader Programs for Particle Dynamics:</strong> The shader programs execute on the GPU and apply attractor dynamics to\neach particle. Following is the attractor function which update the particle positions based on the attractor equation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rendering and Buffer Swapping:</strong> In each frame, the shader computes the new positions based on the attractor's\nequations and stores them in the inactive buffer. After updating, the roles of the FBOs are swapped: The previously\ninactive buffer becomes active, and vice versa.</p></li></ol><p>This combination of efficient shader calculations and the ping-pong technique allows us to render the particle system.</p><p>If you have any comments, please leave them on <strong><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/shashanktomar/blog-discussion/discussions/1\">this GitHub discussions topic</a></strong>.

Providing robust features for data discovery, such as browsing, filtering, and search, has traditionally required dedicated computing infrastructure such as servers and databases. Ongoing server hosting, regular security and software updates, and consistent operational oversight are expensive and require skilled staff. Over years or decades, budget changes and staff turnover often strand these projects in an unmaintained or nonfunctioning state.</p><p>The alternative, static file hosting, requires minimal maintenance and reduces expenses dramatically. For example, storing gigabytes of data on Amazon S3 may cost $1/month or less. However, static hosting often diminishes the capacity for rich data discovery. Without a dynamic computing layer between the user’s web browser and the source files, data access may be restricted to brittle pre-rendered browsing hierarchies or search functionality that is impeded by client memory limits. Under such barriers, the collection’s discoverability suffers.</p><p>For years, online collection discovery has been stuck between a rock and a hard place: accept the complexity and expense required for a good user experience, or opt for simplicity and leave users to contend with the blunt limitations of a static discovery layer.</p><h2>Why We Explored a New Approach</h2><p>When LIL began thinking about how to provide discovery for the <a href=\"https://source.coop/harvard-lil/gov-data/\">Data.gov Archive</a>, we decided that building a lightweight and easily maintained access point from the beginning would be worth our team’s effort. We wanted to provide low-effort discovery with minimal impact on our resources. We also wanted to ensure that whatever path we chose would encourage, rather than impede, long-term access.</p><p>This approach builds on our recent experience when the Caselaw Access Project (CAP) hit <a href=\"https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2024/03/26/transitions-for-the-caselaw-access-project/\">a transition moment</a>. At that time, we elected to switch <a href=\"http://case.law\">case.law</a> to a static site and to partner with others dedicated to open legal data to provide more feature-rich access.</p><p>CAP includes some 11 TB of data; the Data.gov Archive represents nearly 18 TB, with the catalog metadata alone accounting for about 1 GB. Manually browsing the archive data in its repository, even for a user who knows what she’s looking for, is laborious and time-consuming. Thus we faced a challenge. Could we enable dynamic, scalable discovery of the Data.gov Archive while enjoying the frugality, simplicity, and maintainability of static hosting?</p><h2>Our Experiment: Rich Discovery, No Server Required</h2><p>Recent advancements in client-side data analysis led us to try something new. Tools like <a href=\"https://duckdb.org/docs/api/wasm/\">DuckDB-Wasm</a>, <a href=\"https://phiresky.github.io/blog/2021/hosting-sqlite-databases-on-github-pages/\">sql.js-httpvfs</a>, and <a href=\"https://protomaps.com\">Protomaps</a>, powered by standards such as WebAssembly, web workers, and HTTP range requests, allow users to efficiently query large remote datasets in the browser. Rather than downloading a 2 GB data file into memory, these tools can incrementally retrieve only the relevant parts of the file and process query results locally.</p><p>We developed Data.gov Archive Search on the same model. Here’s how it works:</p><ul><li> We store Data.gov Archive catalog metadata as sorted, compressed Parquet files on Source.coop, taking advantage of performant static file hosting.</li><li> Our client-side web application loads DuckDB-Wasm, a fully functional database engine running inside the user’s browser.</li><li> When a user navigates to a resource or submits a search, our DuckDB-Wasm client executes a targeted retrieval of the data needed to fulfill the request. No dedicated server is required; queries run entirely in the browser.</li></ul><p>This experiment has not been without obstacles. Getting good performance out of this model demands careful data engineering, and the large DuckDB-Wasm binary imposes a considerable latency cost. As of this writing, we’re continuing to explore speedy alternatives like <a href=\"https://github.com/hyparam/hyparquet\">hyparquet</a> and <a href=\"https://idl.uw.edu/arquero\">Arquero</a> to further improve performance.</p><p>Still, we’re pleased with the result: an inexpensive, low-maintenance static discovery platform that allows users to browse, search, and filter Data.gov Archive records entirely in the browser.</p><h2>Why This Matters for Libraries, Digital Humanities Projects, and Beyond</h2><p>This new pattern offers a compelling model for libraries, academic archives, and DH projects of all sizes:</p><ul><li> By shifting from an expensive server to lower cost static storage, projects can sustainably offer their users access to data.</li><li><strong>Reduced technical overhead:</strong> With no dedicated backend server, security risks are reduced, no patching or upgrades are needed, and crashing servers are not a concern.</li><li> Projects can be set up with care, but without demanding constant attention. Organizations can be more confident that their archive and discovery interfaces remain usable and accessible, even as staffing or funding changes over time.</li></ul><p>Knowing that we are not the only group interested in approaching access in this way, we’re sharing our generalized learnings. We see a few ways forward for others in the knowledge and information world:</p><ul><li> If your organization has large, relatively static datasets, consider experimenting with a browser-based search tool using static hosting.</li><li> Template applications, workflows, and lessons learned can help this new pattern gain adoption and maturity across the community.</li></ul><p>This project is still evolving, and we invite others—particularly those in libraries and digital cultural heritage—to explore these possibilities with us.

Well, in Austria's case, Florian Zinnagl, CISO of the Ministry of Economy, Energy, and Tourism (BMWET), explained, \"We carry responsibility for a large amount of sensitive data -- from employees, companies, and citizens. As a public institution, we take this responsibility very seriously. That's why we view it critically to rely on cloud solutions from non-European corporations for processing this information.\"</p><p>All of these organizations aim to keep data storage and processing within national or European borders to enhance security, comply with privacy laws such as the <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/gdpr-an-executive-guide-to-what-you-need-to-know/\">EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>, and mitigate risks from potential commercial and foreign government surveillance.&nbsp;</p><p>Open-source software is seen as combining the virtues of faster development and better security, while providing companies and governments with more control, as general manager Thierry Carrez of the <a href=\"https://openinfra.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">OpenInfra Foundation</a> recently suggested: \"Open infrastructure allows nations and organizations to maintain control over their applications, their data, and their destiny while benefiting from global collaboration.\" &nbsp;</p><p>While the US may not like it, with NextCloud's help, BMWET completed its migration in just four months.

Otherwise, you end up with unhappy users.</p><p>That said, BMWET's bold shift to Nextcloud appears to have gone well. This initiative demonstrates that adopting sovereign cloud solutions can be practical, user-friendly, and rapid in the public sector.

Your brain might seem foggy, and your mind drifts off when you should be paying attention.</p><p>A new study from MIT reveals what happens inside the brain as these momentary failures of attention occur. The scientists found that during these lapses, a wave of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flows out of the brain — a process that typically occurs during sleep and helps to wash away waste products that have built up during the day. This flushing is believed to be necessary for maintaining a healthy, normally functioning brain.</p><p>When a person is sleep-deprived, it appears that their body attempts to catch up on this cleansing process by initiating pulses of CSF flow. However, this comes at a cost of dramatically impaired attention.</p><p>“If you don’t sleep, the CSF waves start to intrude into wakefulness where normally you wouldn’t see them. However, they come with an attentional tradeoff, where attention fails during the moments that you have this wave of fluid flow,” says Laura Lewis, the Athinoula A. Martinos Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, a member of MIT’s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science and the Research Laboratory of Electronics, and an associate member of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory.</p><p>Lewis is the senior author of the study, which <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02098-8\" target=\"_blank\">appears today</a> in . MIT visiting graduate student Zinong Yang&nbsp;is the lead author of the paper.</p><p>Although sleep is a critical biological process, it’s not known exactly why it is so important. It appears to be essential for maintaining alertness, and it has been well-documented that sleep deprivation leads to impairments of attention and other cognitive functions.</p><p>During sleep, the cerebrospinal fluid that cushions the brain helps to remove waste that has built up during the day. In a 2019&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax5440\" target=\"_blank\">study</a>, Lewis and colleagues showed that CSF flow during sleep follows a rhythmic pattern in and out of the brain, and that these flows are linked to changes in brain waves during sleep.</p><p>That finding led Lewis to wonder what might happen to CSF flow after sleep deprivation. To explore that question, she and her colleagues recruited 26 volunteers who were tested twice — once following a night of sleep deprivation in the lab, and once when they were well-rested.</p><p>In the morning, the researchers monitored several different measures of brain and body function as the participants performed a task that is commonly used to evaluate the effects of sleep deprivation.</p><p>During the task, each participant wore an electroencephalogram (EEG) cap that could record brain waves while they were also in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner. The researchers used a modified version of fMRI that allowed them to measure not only blood oxygenation in the brain, but also the flow of CSF in and out of the brain. They also measured each subject’s heart rate, breathing rate, and pupil diameter.</p><p>The participants performed two attentional tasks while in the fMRI scanner, one visual and one auditory. For the visual task, they had to look at a screen that had a fixed cross. At random intervals, the cross would turn into a square, and the participants were told to press a button whenever they saw this happen. For the auditory task, they would hear a beep instead of seeing a visual transformation.</p><p>Sleep-deprived participants performed much worse than well-rested participants on these tasks, as expected. Their response times were slower, and for some of the stimuli, the participants never registered the change at all.</p><p>During these momentary lapses of attention, the researchers identified several physiological changes that occurred at the same time. Most significantly, they found a flux of CSF out of the brain just as those lapses occurred. After each lapse, CSF flowed back into the brain.</p><p>“The results are suggesting that at the moment that attention fails, this fluid is actually being expelled outward away from the brain. And when attention recovers, it’s drawn back in,” Lewis says.</p><p>The researchers hypothesize that when the brain is sleep-deprived, it begins to compensate for the loss of the cleansing that normally occurs during sleep, even though these pulses of CSF flow&nbsp;come with the cost of attention loss.</p><p>“One way to think about those events is because your brain is so in need of sleep, it tries its best to enter into a sleep-like state to restore some cognitive functions,” Yang says. “Your brain’s fluid system is trying to restore function by pushing the brain to iterate between high-attention and high-flow states.”</p><p>The researchers also found several other physiological events linked to attentional lapses, including decreases in breathing and heart rate, along with constriction of the pupils. They found that pupil constriction began about 12 seconds before CSF flowed out of the brain, and pupils dilated again after the attentional lapse.</p><p>“What’s interesting is it seems like this isn’t just a phenomenon in the brain, it’s also a body-wide event. It suggests that there’s a tight coordination of these systems, where when your attention fails, you might feel it perceptually and psychologically, but it’s also reflecting an event that’s happening throughout the brain and body,” Lewis says.</p><p>This close linkage between disparate events may indicate that there is a single circuit that controls both attention and bodily functions such as fluid flow, heart rate, and arousal, according to the researchers.</p><p>“These results suggest to us that there’s a unified circuit that’s governing both what we think of as very high-level functions of the brain — our attention, our ability to perceive and respond to the world — and then also really basic fundamental physiological processes like fluid dynamics of the brain, brain-wide blood flow, and blood vessel constriction,” Lewis says.</p><p>In this study, the researchers did not explore what circuit might be controlling this switching, but one good candidate, they say, is the noradrenergic system. Recent research has shown that this system, which regulates many cognitive and bodily functions through the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, oscillates during normal sleep.</p><p>The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Research Fellowship, a NAWA Fellowship, a McKnight Scholar Award, a Sloan Fellowship, a Pew Biomedical Scholar Award, a One Mind Rising Star Award, and the Simons Collaboration on Plasticity in the Aging Brain.</p>","contentLength":6622,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45771636"},{"title":"How OpenAI uses complex and circular deals to fuel its multibillion-dollar rise","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/31/technology/openai-fundraising-deals.html","date":1761915826,"author":"reaperducer","guid":229,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, says that technological revolutions are driven by more than just technology.

What really drives a lot of progress is when people also figure out how to innovate on the financial model,” he recently said at the site of a data center that OpenAI is building in Abilene, Texas.</p><p>Over the last several years, Mr. Altman’s company has found unusual and creative ways of paying for the computing power needed to fuel its ambitions.</p><p>Many of the deals OpenAI has struck — with chipmakers, cloud computing companies and others — are strangely circular. OpenAI receives billions from tech companies before sending those billions back to the same companies to pay for computing power and other services.</p><p>Industry experts and financial analysts have welcomed the start-up’s creativity. But these unorthodox arrangements have also fueled concerns that OpenAI is helping to inflate a potential financial bubble as it builds what is still a highly speculative technology.</p><p>Here are unusual financial agreements helping to drive the ambitions of OpenAI, the poster child of the artificial intelligence revolution.</p><figure></figure><p>From 2019 through 2023, Microsoft was OpenAI’s primary investor. The tech giant pumped more than  into the start-up. Then OpenAI funneled most of those billions back into Microsoft, buying  needed to fuel the development of new A.I. technologies.</p><p>(The New York Times has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html\">sued</a> OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two companies have denied the suit’s claims.)</p><figure></figure><p>By the summer of last year, OpenAI could not get all the computing power it wanted from Microsoft. So it started signing cloud computing contracts with other companies, including Oracle and little-known start-ups with names like CoreWeave.</p><p>Across three different deals signed this year, OpenAI agreed to pay CoreWeave, a company that builds A.I. data centers, more than  for computing power. As part of these agreements, OpenAI received  in CoreWeave stock, which could ultimately help pay for this computing power.</p><figure></figure><p>OpenAI also struggled to get the additional investment dollars it wanted from Microsoft. So, it turned to other investors. Earlier this year, the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank led a  investment in OpenAI.</p><p>At the same time, OpenAI has been working with various companies to build its own computing data centers, rather than rely on cloud computing deals. This also includes SoftBank, which is known for highly speculative technological bets that don’t always pay off. The company is raising  to help OpenAI build data centers in Texas and Ohio.</p><figure></figure><p>Similarly, Oracle, a software and cloud computing giant, has agreed to spend  building new data centers for OpenAI in Texas, New Mexico, Michigan and Wisconsin. OpenAI will then pay Oracle roughly the same amount to use these  over the next several years.</p><figure></figure><p>The United Arab Emirates was part of an OpenAI’s fund-raising round in October 2024. Now, G42, a firm with close ties to the Emirati government, is building a roughly  for OpenAI in the Emirates.</p><figure></figure><p>Last month, Nvidia announced that it intended to invest  in OpenAI over the next several years. This could help OpenAI pay for its new data centers. As OpenAI buys or leases specialized chips from Nvidia, Nvidia will pump billions back into OpenAI.</p><figure></figure><p>Two weeks later, OpenAI signed an agreement with AMD that allows OpenAI to buy up to  in the chipmaker at a penny per share. That translates to roughly a 10 percent stake in the company. This stock could supply OpenAI with additional capital as it works to build new data centers.</p><p>OpenAI pulls in billions of dollars in revenue each year from customers who pay for ChatGPT, computer programming tools and other technologies. But it still loses more money than it makes, according to a person familiar with the company’s finances.</p><p>If the company can use its new data centers to significantly improve A.I. technologies and expand its revenue over the next several years, it can become a viable business, as Mr. Altman believes it will. If technology progress stalls, OpenAI – and its many partners – could lose enormous amounts of money. Smaller companies like CoreWeave, which are taking on enormous amounts of debt to build new data centers, could go bankrupt.</p><p>In some cases, companies are hedging their bets. Nvidia and AMD, for instance, have the option of reducing the cash and stock they send to OpenAI if the A.I. market does not expand as quickly as expected. But others would be left with enormous debt, which could send ripples across the larger economy.</p>","contentLength":4718,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45771538"},{"title":"My Impressions of the MacBook Pro M4","url":"https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/","date":1761905620,"author":"secure","guid":228,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I have been using a MacBook Pro M4 as my portable computer for the last half a\nyear and wanted to share a few short impressions. As always, I am not a\nprofessional laptop reviewer, so in this article you won’t find benchmarks, just\nsubjective thoughts!</p><p>Back in 2021, I wrote about the <a href=\"https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2021-11-28-macbook-air-m1/\">MacBook Air\nM1</a>, which was the first computer I used that\ncontained Apple’s own ARM-based CPU. Having a silent laptop with long battery\nlife was a game-changer, so I wanted to keep those properties.</p><p>When the US government announced tariffs, I figured I would replace my 4-year\nold MacBook Air M1 with a more recent model that should last a few more\nyears. Ultimately, Apple’s prices remained stable, so, in retrospect, I could\nhave stayed with the M1 for a few more years. Oh well.</p><h2>The nano-textured display</h2><p>I went to the Apple Store to compare the different options in\nperson. Specifically, I was curious about the display and whether the increased\nweight and form factor of the MacBook Pro (compared to a MacBook Air) would be\nacceptable. Another downside of the Pro model is that it comes with a fan, and I\nreally like absolutely quiet computers. Online, I read from other MacBook Pro\nowners that the fan mostly stays off.</p><p>In general, I would have preferred to go with a MacBook Air because it has\nenough compute power for my needs and I like the case better (no ventilation\nslots), but unfortunately only the MacBook Pro line has the better displays.</p><p>Why aren’t all displays nano-textured? The employee at the Apple Store presented\nthe trade-off as follows: The nano texture display is great at reducing\nreflections, at the expense of also making the picture slightly less vibrant.</p><p>I could immediately see the difference when placing two laptops side by side:\nThe bright Apple Store lights showed up very prominently on the normal display\n(left), and were almost not visible at all on the nano texture display (right):</p><a href=\"https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/2025-10-30-macbooks-displays.jpg\"><img srcset=\"https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/2025-10-30-macbooks-displays_hu_8c87fe476c5344b6.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/2025-10-30-macbooks-displays_hu_243730d5507ecc98.jpg 3x\" src=\"https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/2025-10-30-macbooks-displays_hu_4cb7e6e8fae8437.jpg\" alt=\"MacBook Air (left) vs. MacBook Pro (right)\" title=\"MacBook Air (left) vs. MacBook Pro (right)\" width=\"600\" height=\"409\" loading=\"lazy\"></a><p>Personally, I did not perceive a big difference in “vibrancy”, so my choice was\nclear: I’ll pick the MacBook Pro over the MacBook Air (despite the weight) for\nthe nano texture display!</p><p>After using the laptop in a number of situations, I am very happy with this\nchoice. In normal scenarios, I notice no reflections at all (where my previous\nlaptop did show reflections!). This includes using the laptop on a train (next\nto the window), or using the laptop outside in daylight.</p><p>(When I chose the new laptop, Apple’s M4 chips were current. By now, they have\nreleased the first devices with M5 chips.)</p><p>I decided to go with the MacBook Pro with M4 chip instead of the M4  chip\nbecause I don’t need the extra compute, and the M4 needs less cooling — the M4\nPro apparently runs hotter. This increases the chance of the fan staying off.</p><p>Here are the specs I ended up with:</p><ul><li>14\" Liquid Retina XDR Display with nano texture</li><li>Apple M4 Chip (10 core CPU, 10 core GPU)</li><li>32 GB RAM (this is the maximum!), 2 TB SSD (enough for this computer)</li></ul><p>One thing I noticed is that the MacBook Pro M4 sometimes gets warm, even when it\nis connected to power, but is suspended to RAM (and has been fully charged for\nhours). I’m not sure why.</p><p>Luckily, the fan indeed stays silent. I think I might have heard it spin up once\nin half a year or so?</p><p>The battery life is amazing! The previous MacBook Air M1 had amazing all-day\nbattery life already, and this MacBook Pro M4 lasts even longer. For example,\nwatching videos on a train ride (with VLC) for 3 hours consumed only 10% of\nbattery life. I generally never even carry the charger.</p><p>Because of that, Apple’s re-introduction of MagSafe, a magnetic power connector\n(so you don’t damage the laptop when you trip over it), is nice-to-have but\ndoesn’t really make much of a difference anymore. In fact, it might be better to\npack a USB-C cable when traveling, as that makes you more flexible in how you\nuse the charger.</p><p>I was curious whether the 120 Hz display would make a difference in practice. I\nmostly notice the increased refresh rate when there are animations, but not,\nfor example, when scrolling.</p><p>One surprising discovery (but obvious in retrospect) is that even non-animations\ncan become faster. For example, when running a Go web server on , I\nnoticed that navigating between pages by clicking links felt faster on the 120\nHz display!</p><p>The following illustration shows why that is, using a page load that takes 6ms\nof processing time. There are three cases (the illustration shows an average\ncase and the worst case):</p><ol><li>Best case: Page load finishes  the next frame is displayed: no delay.</li><li>Worst case: Page load finishes  a frame is displayed: one frame of delay.</li><li>Most page loads are somewhere in between. We’ll have 0.x to 1.0 frames of delay</li></ol><a href=\"https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/2025-10-31-delay-60-vs-120.svg\"><img src=\"https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/2025-10-31-delay-60-vs-120.svg\" alt=\"delay\" title=\"delay\" loading=\"lazy\"></a><p>As you can see, the waiting time becomes shorter when going from 60 Hz (one\nframe every 16.6ms) to 120 Hz (one frame every 8.3ms). So if you’re working with\na system that has &lt;8ms response times, you might observe actions completing (up\nto) twice as fast!</p><p>I don’t notice going back to 60 Hz displays on computers. However, on phones,\nwhere a lot more animations are a key part of the user experience, I think 120\nHz displays are more interesting.</p><p>My ideal MacBook would probably be a MacBook Air, but with the nano-texture display! :)</p><p>I still don’t like macOS and would prefer to run Linux on this laptop. But\n<a href=\"https://asahilinux.org/\">Asahi Linux</a> still needs some work before it’s usable\nfor me (I need external display output, and M4 support).

Relentless <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/08/11/ices-spectacle-of-intimidation\">documentation</a> has proved something of an effective tool against President Donald Trump’s empowerment of ; agents have taken to wearing masks in fear of exposure, and the proliferation of imagery showing armed police and mobilized National Guard troops in otherwise calm cities has underlined the cruel absurdity of their activities. Activist memes have been minted on social media: a woman on New York’s Canal Street, dressed in a polka-dotted office-casual dress, flipping  agents off; a man in Washington, D.C., throwing a Subway sandwich at a federal agent in August. The recent “No Kings” marches were filled with protesters in inflatable frog costumes, inspired by a similarly outfitted man who got pepper-sprayed protesting outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Building in Portland, Oregon. Some might write the memes off as resistance porn, but digital content is at least serving as a lively defense mechanism in the absence of functional politics.</p><p>At the same time, social media has served as a reinvigorated source of transparency in recent weeks, harking back to the days when Twitter became an organizing tool during the Arab Spring, in the early twenty-tens, or when Facebook and Instagram helped fuel the Black Lives Matter marches of 2020. The grassroots optimism of that earlier social-media era is long gone, though, replaced by a sense of posting as a last resort. After Trump authorized the deployment of the National Guard <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/the-conflict-on-the-streets-of-chicago\">in Chicago</a> earlier this month, the governor of Illinois, J.&nbsp;B. Pritzker, told residents to “record and narrate what you see—put it on social media.” But, if the anti- opposition is taking advantage of the internet,  and the Trump Administration are, too. Right-wing creators have been using the same channels to identify and publicize targets for raids. According to reporting in Semafor, the Trump-friendly YouTuber Nick Shirley’s videos of African migrant vendors on Canal Street seemed to help drive recent  sweeps of the area.  itself is also working to monitor social media. The investigative outlet  found documents revealing that the agency has enlisted an A.I.-driven surveillance product called Zignal Labs that creates “curated detection feeds” to aid in criminal investigations. According to reporting in ,  also has plans to build out a team of dozens of analysts to monitor social media and identify targets. Recent videos, identified by 404 Media and other publications, have purportedly shown  agents using technology developed by the data-analytics firm Palantir, founded by Peter Thiel and others, to scan social-media accounts, government records, and biometrics data of those they detain. Social media has become a political panopticon in which your posts are a conduit for your politics, and what you post can increasingly be used against you.</p><p>Meanwhile, a new wave of digital tools has emerged to help surveil the surveillants. The apps ICEBlock, Red Dot, and DEICER all allow users to pinpoint where  agents are active, forming an online version of a whisper network to alert potential targets. Eyes Up provides a way for users to record and upload footage of abusive law-enforcement activity, building an archive of potential evidence. Its creator is a software developer named Mark (who uses only his first name to separate the project from his professional work); he was inspired to create Eyes Up earlier this year, when he began seeing clips of  abductions and harassment circulating on social media and worried about their shelf life. As he put it to me, “They could disappear at any given moment, whether the platforms decide to moderate, whether the individual deletes their account or the post.”</p><p>Ultimately, the app itself was also vulnerable to sudden disappearance. After launching, on September 1st, Eyes Up accumulated thousands of downloads and thousands of minutes of uploaded footage. Then, on October 3rd, Mark received a notice that Apple was removing the app from its store on the grounds that it may “harm a targeted individual or group.” Eyes Up is not alone. ICEBlock and Red Dot have been blocked from both Apple and Google’s app stores, the two largest marketplaces; DEICER, like Eyes Up, was removed by Apple. Pressure on the tech platforms seemed to come from the Trump Administration; after a deadly shooting at an  field office in Dallas in late September, the Attorney General, Pam Bondi, said in a statement to Fox News Digital that ICEBlock “put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs.” Mark is contesting Apple’s decision about Eyes Up through its official channels, and the creator of ICEBlock, Joshua Aaron, has argued that his app should be treated no differently than services, such as Google’s Waze, that allow users to warn one another of highway speed traps. But for now they must try to make do with a limited reach.</p>","contentLength":5138,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45767325"},{"title":"Kimi Linear: An Expressive, Efficient Attention Architecture","url":"https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-Linear","date":1761869256,"author":"blackcat201","guid":222,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45766937"},{"title":"Leaker reveals which Pixels are vulnerable to Cellebrite phone hacking","url":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/leaker-reveals-which-pixels-are-vulnerable-to-cellebrite-phone-hacking/","date":1761865930,"author":"akyuu","guid":221,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45766501"},{"title":"A change of address led to our Wise accounts being shut down","url":"https://shaun.nz/why-were-never-using-wise-again-a-cautionary-tale-from-a-business-burned/","date":1761864110,"author":"jemmyw","guid":220,"unread":true,"content":"<p>For years, one of my businesses has been a regular user of  (formerly TransferWise).

I politely explained that in <strong>New Zealand, a “tax invoice” is a legal form of a bill</strong> – even down to the name “tax invoice” being a legal requirement by IRD, and that’s how telecommunications companies issue invoices here. But she refused to accept it.</p><blockquote><p>“It needs to say  at the top,” she insisted.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“A tax invoice isn’t acceptable.”</p></blockquote><p>This is simply , and completely out of touch with New Zealand’s business documentation standards.

The decision was made, and we were , permanently.</p><p>To summarise the absurdity of this:</p><ul><li>We moved office, and updated our address with Wise</li><li>We provided a legal, NZ-compliant  showing our entity and address</li><li>It was rejected because it was labelled a “Tax Invoice”</li><li>A rep told us to lease a coworking desk elsewhere just to get a different document</li><li>A senior rep agreed we were right, and escalated it</li><li>Then <strong>our accounts were shut down – with no explanation or recourse</strong></li></ul><p>Even trying to call support now gets an automated message: “Because your account is restricted, we cannot connect you.”</p><h2><strong>⚠️ Our Final Word: Be Very, Very Careful</strong></h2><p>We had used Wise for . Regular monthly supplier payments. International stock orders. Five-figure transactions. Never a problem – until this. A minor change triggered a totally flawed process that , with no transparency or logical path to resolution.</p><p>We’re not alone – a quick search shows <strong>many others facing similar horror stories</strong> with Wise.</p><p>So this is my word of warning:</p><blockquote><p>💡 <strong>Don’t put all your eggs in the Wise basket.</strong></p></blockquote><p>If you’re a business, don’t rely on them as your sole means of transferring funds. For us, it’s back to traditional banks – slower, yes, but at least <strong>they have humans you can talk to, and actual escalation paths</strong>.</p><h2>🧾 <strong>28th October update on our Wise debacle – it gets worse.</strong></h2><p>Following the so-called “appeal” (which gave us no option to provide any information), we received the unsurprising outcome: Wise has decided to  as we had <strong>breached their acceptable use policy</strong>. 🤨</p><p>What was surprising, however, was the  they gave after I queried what was breached in Wise’s Acceptable Use Policy:</p><p>I was told my  was being closed for allegedly breaching their Acceptable Use Policy — specifically, section 1.4.e, which states <em>“you may not use your personal Wise account to receive business payments.”</em></p><p>I’ve  used my personal account for business transactions — in fact, over 99% of transfers were to overseas family members. When I asked for clarification or examples, I got none. Just a vague statement and the very strange line:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Just because we can’t offer you our services going forward doesn’t mean that we think your business activities are illegal or illegitimate — it just means that we don’t support those types of activities.”</em></p></blockquote><p>What activities?! Again, </p><p>To make matters worse — our business account’s refund transfer . Why? Because it requires documentation — the  Wise previously rejected for address verification, claiming a <em>telecommunications tax invoice isn’t a bill</em>.</p><p>After a few days, the transfer was then cancelled as of course, Wise was unable to “verify” us.</p><p>So now our , their support ticket is marked “final response,” and our attempts to get clarity have gone nowhere. We’ve escalated the issue to <strong>Financial Services Complaints Ltd</strong>, Wise’s dispute resolution provider in New Zealand.</p><p>Funds stuck. No clear reason. No accountability. Wise still gets a 0/10 from us.</p><p>This isn’t just poor service — it’s unacceptable.</p><p><strong>Think twice before trusting Wise with your money.</strong></p>","contentLength":7250,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45766253"},{"title":"Phone numbers for use in TV shows, films and creative works","url":"https://www.acma.gov.au/phone-numbers-use-tv-shows-films-and-creative-works","date":1761860951,"author":"nomilk","guid":219,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45765787"}],"tags":["dev"]}
