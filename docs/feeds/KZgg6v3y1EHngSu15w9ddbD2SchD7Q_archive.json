Or rather, it isn’t true in the sense most people think. For example, it is presently 2024-12-25 at 18:54:53 UTC. The POSIX time is 1735152686. It has been 1735152715 seconds since the POSIX epoch. The POSIX time number is twenty-nine seconds lower.</p>\n<p>This is because POSIX time is derived <a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/FIPS/fipspub151-1.pdf\">in IEEE 1003.1</a> from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time\">Coordinated Universal Time</a>. The standard assumes that every day is exactly 86,400 seconds long. Specifically:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The <em>time()</em> function returns the value of time in <b>seconds since the Epoch</b>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><b>seconds since the Epoch.</b> A value to be interpreted as the number of seconds between a specified time and the Epoch. A Coordinated Universal Time name (specified in terms of seconds (<em>tm_sec</em>), minutes (<em>tm_min</em>), hours (<em>tm_hour</em>), days since January 1 of the year (<em>tm_yday</em>), and calendar year minus 1900\n(<em>tm_year</em>)) is related to a time represented as <em>seconds since the Epoch</em> according to the expression below.</p>\n<p>If year &lt; 1970 or the value is negative, the relationship is undefined. If year ≥ 1970 and the value is non-negative, the value is related to a Coordinated Universal Time name according to the expression:</p>\n<p><em>tm_sec</em> + <em>tm_min</em> * 60 + <em>tm_hour</em> * 3600 + <em>tm_yday</em> * 86400 +\n(<em>tm_year</em>-70) * 31536000 + ((<em>tm_year</em> - 69) / 4) * 86400</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The length of the day is not 86,400 seconds, and in fact changes over time. To keep UTC days from drifting too far from solar days, astronomers periodically declare a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second\">leap second</a> in UTC. Consequently, every few years POSIX time jumps backwards, <a href=\"https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&amp;m=134113577921904\">wreaking</a> <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/qantas-suffers-delays-due-to-linux-leap-second-bug/\">utter</a> <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-and-why-the-leap-second-affected-cloudflare-dns/\">havoc</a>. Someday it might jump forward.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#archaeology\" id=\"archaeology\">Archaeology</a></h2>\n<p>Appendix B of IEEE 1003 has a fascinating discussion of leap seconds:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The concept of leap seconds is added for precision; at the time this standard was published, 14 leap seconds had been added since January 1, 1970. These 14 seconds are ignored to provide an easy and compatible method of computing time differences.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I, too, love to ignore things to make my life easy. The standard authors knew “seconds since the epoch” were not, in fact, seconds since the epoch. And they admit as much:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most systems’ notion of “time” is that of a continuously-increasing value, so this value should increase even during leap seconds. However, not only do most systems not keep track of leap seconds, but most systems are probably not synchronized to any standard time reference. Therefore, it is inappropriate to require that a time represented as seconds since the Epoch precisely represent the number of seconds between the referenced time and the Epoch.</p>\n<p>It is sufficient to require that applications be allowed to treat this time as if it represented the number of seconds between the referenced time and the Epoch. It is the responsibility of the vendor of the system, and the administrator of the system, to ensure that this value represents the number of seconds between the referenced time and the Epoch as closely as necessary for the application being run on that system….</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I imagine there was some debate over this point. The appendix punts, saying that vendors and administrators must make time align “as closely as necessary”, and that “this value should increase even during leap seconds”. The latter is achievable, but the former is arguably impossible: the standard requires POSIX clocks be twenty-nine seconds off.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Consistent interpretation of seconds since the Epoch can be critical to certain types of distributed applications that rely on such timestamps to synchronize events. The accrual of leap seconds in a time standard is not predictable. The number of leap seconds since the Epoch will likely increase. The standard is\nmore concerned about the synchronization of time between applications of astronomically short duration and the Working Group expects these concerns to become more critical in the future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a sense, the opposite happened. Time synchronization is <em>always</em> off, so systems generally function (however incorrectly) when times drift a bit. But leap seconds are rare, and the linearity evoked by the phrase “seconds since the epoch” is so deeply baked in to our intuition, that software can accrue serious, unnoticed bugs. Until a few years later, one of those tiny little leap seconds takes down a big chunk of the internet.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#what-to-do-instead\" id=\"what-to-do-instead\">What To Do Instead</a></h2>\n<p>If you just need to compute the duration between two events on one computer, use <a href=\"https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux_for_real_time/7/html/reference_guide/sect-posix_clocks#sect-POSIX_clocks\">CLOCK_MONOTONIC</a>. If you don’t need to exchange timestamps with other systems that assume POSIX time, use <a href=\"https://www.ipses.com/eng/in-depth-analysis/standard-of-time-definition/\">TAI, GPS, or maybe LORAN</a>. If you do need rough alignment with other POSIX-timestamp systems, <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/time/smear\">smear leap seconds</a> over a longer window of time.

Drawing parallels with self-driving cars, he suggests the role of software engineers will evolve from code authors to operators of code-generating machines. Taylor, a board member of OpenAI and who once rewrote Google Maps over a weekend, calls for new programming systems, languages, and verification methods to ensure AI-generated code remains robust and secure. From his post: In the Autonomous Era of software engineering, the role of a software engineer will likely transform from being the author of computer code to being the operator of a code generating machine. What is a computer programming system built natively for that workflow? \n\nIf generating code is no longer a limiting factor, what types of programming languages should we build? \n\nIf a computer is generating most code, how do we make it easy for a software engineer to verify it does what they intend? What is the role of programming language design (e.g., what Rust did for memory safety)? What is the role of formal verification? What is the role of tests, CI/CD, and development workflows? \n\nToday, a software engineer's primary desktop is their editor.

I store and search similar vectors using Milvus [^2] and finally use Gradio [^3] to serve the frontend.

This is because every part needs to be dynamic and optimized for speed.<p>So a few years ago I've started to work on a web browser that intentionally doesn't implement JavaScript, instead it contains an updated set of scripts that fix and improve various websites.<p>I've been using this approach using a proxy server for a few years as my primary way of web browsing with good results. It uses a whitelist approach where no resources are loaded from different domains by default (the fix scripts can override it to load images from CDNs, etc.). This avoids any trackers by default.<p>You can find more details on the homepage of the project:<p><a href=\"https://www.fixbrowser.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.fixbrowser.org/</a><p>I'm currently running a fundraiser to get it really going. All the foundation blocks are there it just needs some more work.
