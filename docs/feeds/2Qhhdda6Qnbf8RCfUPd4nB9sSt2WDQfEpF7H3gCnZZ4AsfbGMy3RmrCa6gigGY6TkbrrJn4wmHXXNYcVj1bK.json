I&#39;m just dropping a heads up that I have archived <a href=\"https://github.com/jeaye/ncurses-rs\">https://github.com/jeaye/ncurses-rs</a> and will not be developing it further.</p> <p>I first made ncurses-rs nearly 11 years ago and both Rust and its library ecosystem were incredibly different back then. Over the past decade, my attention has shifted to focus on other projects and ncurses-rs has received some love from the community to help it along. For that, I&#39;m grateful.</p> <p>These days, with Rust&#39;s rich and thriving library ecosystem, having such a thin wrapper around ncurses as a common TUI choice does more a disservice than anything. Projects like ratatui, cursive, and others do a much better job of embracing why we use Rust in the first place.</p> <p>ncurses-rs is MIT licensed, so anyone may pick up where I left off, but please consider my point regarding what we as a community want people to be using. It shouldn&#39;t include unsafe, thin wrappers for terribly unsafe C libs. :)</p> <p>&lt;also posted on Lobsters and IRC so that people can know and migrate accordingly&gt;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Jeaye\"> /u/Jeaye </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hm847x/ncursesrs_has_been_archived/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hm847x/ncursesrs_has_been_archived/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"My first crate on crates.io - simple primitives for parsing/storing Windows SIDs on all platforms","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hm4cda/my_first_crate_on_cratesio_simple_primitives_for/","date":1735145976,"author":"/u/panicnot42","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"&#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/panicnot42\"> /u/panicnot42 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://docs.rs/win-sid/0.1.0/win_sid/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hm4cda/my_first_crate_on_cratesio_simple_primitives_for/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"[Media] Crocheted Ferris for my husband.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hm2x9l/media_crocheted_ferris_for_my_husband/","date":1735141332,"author":"/u/laylacoosic","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>He&#39;s a little wonky but cute.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/laylacoosic\"> /u/laylacoosic </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/gdkg48v0m09e1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hm2x9l/media_crocheted_ferris_for_my_husband/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"[Media] Ferris making my desk safe with memories","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hm1txq/media_ferris_making_my_desk_safe_with_memories/","date":1735137513,"author":"/u/subtlename","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"&#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/subtlename\"> /u/subtlename </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/gzzzciuka09e1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hm1txq/media_ferris_making_my_desk_safe_with_memories/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"A 2024 Plea for Lean Software (with running code) - Bert Hubert's writings","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hly4jq/a_2024_plea_for_lean_software_with_running_code/","date":1735121409,"author":"/u/Alexander_Selkirk","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"&#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Alexander_Selkirk\"> /u/Alexander_Selkirk </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/a-2024-plea-for-lean-software/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hly4jq/a_2024_plea_for_lean_software_with_running_code/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""}]}
